     Preliminary concepts




	 What I'd like to do is to associate different pieces of the text with unique attributes.  I don't actually want to write that js right now so I'm going to just associate with unique IDs thusly:
	 	  ** each letter will get annotations named annMONTHDAYYEAR#
		  ** associated text will be placed in a span with an ID txtMONTHDAYYEAR#

		  The js will, on mouseover of the annotation (hopefully) change background color on both the span and the annotation itself
		  It won't be cyan so nobody freak out I just knew that html can handle "cyan"

Dear Em.</br>
</br>
I now take the pleasure to write a few lines. to you as I have not received a letter from you since the one dated the sixth of January. and here it is 23rd of the month.  hopeing this will find you enjoying good health and spirits as it leaves me at present. only the weather is bad. it has done nothing for the last week but snow rain and hail. the mud is knee deep all around camp. it makes me sick and tired of camp life. nothing to do but eat. drink and sleep. not even drills to attend to I have almost wished I was home the last week. I am afraid when I do get home I will almost be to lasy to work. I layed last Sunday and Monday evening thinking of you especially monday night. honestly I did expect to be home to go to that ball. I can not say when I will be home as Gen Mc Clelland has stopped all fourlough to officers and men any how there is some trouble about the officers. not being legally appointed if they can prove it. they will send my commision up in a balloon. and I will not receive a cent for the last two months I begin to think that their is some truth in it as the regiment has not been paid off yet. if it is true. myself along with ten others that Col Cogswell has appointed will be home in a short time after they got the Col out of the way they are trying to get his freinds out of the way. so they can have the regiment to themselves. but I hope we will defeat all their plans. our new col is here and he I think is with us also Gen Stone is working against the other side. but they have Congressmen a working for them. I saw in the baltimore paper that the river was frozen over at Conrads ford and that our boys and the rebels were skating toghether of freindly terms. which is no such a things for the potomac has not had a bit of ice into it this winter.  I had to laugh when I read it. to see how reports get in the paper Mr G is still here. I dont think he will go home untill the regt gets payed off. there is no news worth writing about. I hardly know what to put in letters to fill them.  it is always the one thing out here and a person gets tired of it. Oh for a march to drive dull care away.  it would be a blessing to hear marching oders read out I am afraid there is no such good luck for this regt. if the Army advances we will have to stand still where we are as the regt is in no condition at present to carry on battle remmember me kindly to your folks I will draw this to a close by sending my affectionate love to you  Ever Truly Yours</br>

I will not be able to get to the city before I go for we expect to go away tomorrow or on Friday.  I asked the colnel to let me down, he said he could not let a man out of camp and if I don’t get down on Thursday,  I wish you would send those havelock up on Friday with Walter in the 10 o clock boat and I will be at the dock to meet him.  I don’t know which way we will go, but there is some talk of going down Brooklyn, but I don’t think there is such good luck in store for us Dear Emily.  I hope your are well, and give my compliments to all the folks.  Tell Sarah that expect some thing from her, because she must keep her promise if one should go down ???  I  will be on the look out for you, I will be on the right hand side going down, the drum is a beating for drills Now I must close for the present.</br>

Dear Emily</br>
</br>
I wrote a letter to you from great neck that we would leave the next morning at three o clock, but did not leave till 5 o clock in the afternoon in the steamboat for Elizaport where we took the cars for Baltimore, we arrived at Baltimore the next night at 10 o clock, and had the pleasure of marching through to the cars for Washington at which place we arrived at 10 o clock the next morning traveling 41 hours with about out getting out of the cars but at Baltimore, we marched through Washington about 3 miles to our place of encampment – through the dust & heat you better belief that we were worn out, but we pitched our tents and got every thing to rights.  and then I thought it was time to write to you to tell you that I am well and good spirits I don’t get much of a chance to go about Washington for I have to be in camp all the time I cant ask the colnel to let me have a pass of 24 hours to go to the city to see you, that played out be I tried hard to come to the city on wenesday afternoon but the colnel came up in the same boat that I was a going down on and he would not let go he said I would not have time, but the poor fellow did not think his time was so near up, the first night we were here he was taken sick and died at 2 o clock this morning he will be taking to the city tomorrow morning by Captain Jas Graham.  Emily I wish you would write as soon as you get this letter and send it to his house No 45 Perry St, also send those havelock because I want them, I have got three of them already but they were not made by you, and you know that that they are not half as good as the ones you will send, and tell me whether you got that likeness and how you like that boy in soser close, I have seen  2 of the fire exoreaves in the camp and they say that about 600 of them was killed, the 99th when calling the roll this morning they had only 175 men the rest is all killed or wounded, the 71st & 8th New York was cut up badly, I have got that account from one 79th own lips also from of one of the ex-slaaves the rebels as soon mow us down they would run up and to him, beat him whi with the butt end of a musket so to be sure he was killed they fight like mad men, but we will draw them in as soon as we get are artillery & calvery to work on them for it is not any use to send men with musket to be shot down like dogs, I send my best respect to Father, Mother, Louise, Sarah and Walter, and I send my love to you Emily please to write as soon as you can so to send it up with Jimmy the weather is not so hot here as it was in  great neck the next time I write I will let you know something about Washington it is a raining here very fast and we have to stay in our tents,</br>

</br>
Dear Emily</br>
</br>
I received your letter of 31st.  I was thinking you did not get it.  I hope you are well as I am at present.  I would have answered it before but there is a rumor that we would change our quarters Mrs Graham was in Washington last Friday but we did not see her.  She sent Mr Woods up to the camp with those things.  I was am extremely obliged to you for sending them to me.  Those hankerchefs came very exceptable to me the havelocks are a little to small for the caps that we are a going to get the next time you write I expect to be at seneca falls but you can direct your letter the same.  You say you in your last letter that you thought I had forgotten you.  I don’t know how you could thought any such thing for I am thinking of you all the time especially on Sunday & wenesday night I am looking to time that this war was over of which I will be very glad every time I write the boys say the post man will know where somebody lives they think that all letters are for or from you.  Those cigars was very nice that what in call a treat nowadays for they will not let us go out of camp.  They keep us in as if were prison birds you can’t see a soldier in Washington sure as one show himself he is arrested by the regulars but I got on the right side of the colonel last week and get a pass for seven hours if I did not see Washington than nobody ever did I was all through the capitol saw the senators meet and was in the house of representatives saw the white house all the public buildings Willard hotel is the only place where there is any excitement.  There is always a crowd around it.  I had to laugh as was passing <span id = "txtAUG1718611">the tree where Keyes was shot the bark</span> is stripped off of it about eleven feet high every stranger comes along take a piece off. I heard from Mr. Graham this morning he is getting along very well the doctor says he don’t think he will be lame.  Jim is impatient to get out he thinks he can walk as well as ever but the docs tell him to wait a little while longer.  You spoke about Sarah she says to turn my toes out but tell to practice what she preaches tell her to my respect to she know who I heard say that you was a going to give me hail  Columbia for not mentioning about capt Graham the reason I did not say anything about it was because I could not get any information about it so I could not tell thi the truth about I can not tell you anything about the troops for all the information we get is from the new York herald Emily I wish you would send some write as soon as get this for I don’t know how soon we will move give my respect to all folks I also send my love to you</br>

Dear Emma</br>
</br>
I received your letter of wenesday evening the 21st under a heavy fire of bomb shells and rifle balls which was a flying around us.  Thick & fast, we left camp on Saturday morning when we got near the ferry the  Colonel marched us in single file five paces apart through the woods & corn fields which was very good shelter but  we had to go across an open field the enemy let us get out into the field when they opened fire on us, I have heard of dodging cannon balls before but I did not believe it till to day we had to go on a double quick for a quarter of a mile to get under cover of some woods on the advance all the time they kept up a steady fire all time with XXX shell which busted all around us and XXX nobody hurt but we could not see them so we did not fire a shot so we had XXX to wait in the woods till dark then XXX we went down to the XXX a great many of us in a little house that stood by the ferry so they put the guns on the house & sent three 6 pounders right strait through the chimney & three pastions  they kept up a fire on us all day long at night we sent for 30 sharps shooters of the Minnesota regiment the next when they fixed fire across the Potomac river the sharp shooters let fly with their rifles and sun made them move their cannon so we did not hear from them all day long we thought they were up to something as we were eating supper they let fly four shells at us one of bursted right by ware the officers were eating.  A piece of the shell spilt the coffee that they were drinking for a night cap, but we have not heard from them for two days I suppose they were called off I heard firing farther down XXX the Potomac or have dug trenches so they XXX can fire a much as they like they can XXX not harm us without the shells fall in XXX the trenches.  Em you say you had your XXX hair cut short i would like to  see you XXX please me for I want to see you so bad you said that you were sorry that we had such a quarter master, but we have plenty to eat since we left Rockville we can get most anything we want in the eating line, you say you hope it wont be three years before I come back I don’t think it will  I think I will in New York in febuary on a furlough for about 10 days if every thing goes on right. Give my respect to your folks also to Mrs. Dennison when you see her tell her I would write to her but I don’t have such time I will try and write to her next week I sorry your work has been so dull to you I think it will be worse before this war is over I must bid you good.

Dear Emily</br>
</br>
I sent you letter on the 20th of August have never received an answer to it I hope you are well as I was never in better health in my life the last letter I wrote to you, I give the details of a lively skirmish we had with the rebels at Conrads Ferry where we have been on picket for 22 days as we came up to camp last night I went strait to the post office for the letters there was one from my Brother but none from you which I expected to be there sure but I suppose you did not get my last letter of which I am very sorry for I want to hear from you very bad I also want to see you, as your letter states that you had your hair cut I wish you would get a likeness taken on paper and send it in the next letter you send you said something about Jimmy Maguire being sick, who is getting up such reports as he has not had a day sickness that I know off, my Brother had the same thing in his letter.  We expect to get paid off next week.  I will have about 80 dollars I don’t know what I will do with it I am afraid to send it to new York as it may never reach there as every thing don’t go that we send I expect it will pretty near all be in paper which you could not change without going to brokers office.  If you think I had better send it to you please write so I thought it would be better to send it to my Brother Henry and then he could put it the bank but I am perturbed about what to do with it.  For if I keep it I may loose it we had two men wound out at conrads ferry but it did not amount to any thing if always got off as lucky after being in in such a fire as they let us have as shells was bursting all around as I hear they are great many complaints about the soldiers food but you not believe all you hear about it as we have plenty of good & wholesome I aint got no fault to find with a soldier life if I could only get to new york once in a while those fellows that grumble about food is that class which never get a good meal in there life we have got about a dozen in our company which I have got a good deal of trouble with them we have expected the rebels to cross over at the ferry but I guess they have given it up we picket hay a midst to reach others every day one of the 17th Missippi regiments was over on our side he says that they all want to go home he thought that their  would be no war or he should never have come for soldier.  They don’t seem to like fitting a bit, I expect we will have a great battle soon which will decide it  Genearl  McClellan says we have made our last retreat the next move must be to victory of which I hope will be soon.  Give my respect to all the folks also to Sarah’s young man I cant never think of his name I wish you would answer immediatly I will close now by sending my love to you</br>

Dear Emily</br>
</br>
having arrived safe after being delayed at Washington for a day & night i arrived at camp on saturday night at 7 o clock the company looked very slim i could not realize it till the plan fact began to show themselves when i began to ask where so and so was those that were left told me that they were gone.  Em out 97 men i have only 46 to take charge of, the rest is all taken prisoner or drowned as the river was very high and running very fast.  Some of the boys swam very near across and went down.  Their cries was awfull to hear.  Charley Macpherson James Gillis Bob Crawford. George Odell are taken prisoner.   John Maguire & Billy Smith saved themselves by swimming across from all accounts the battle was perfect murder.  the enemy was on top of a hill a firing right down on top of us we having no show at them. their reenforcements arriving every minuet. they had inside of an half an hour over 15 thousand there. we could not get any more than 30 or 40 over at a time for we had only one boat.  it was a badly managed affair and caused the union a great loss.  they seem to blame Gen Baker for the whole of it you need not say anything about G. Odell till you hear from me.  i don’t know how i feel having lost all my former associates it seems to be all a dream and our colonel gone to i almost wish i was with them they had to throw every thing they had away so as to swim across it was afull you must excuse me for not writing more but i don’t feel like it.  i feel more like thinking to day so no more at present.  i send you my affectional love with my respect to your folks</br>

Dear Em,</br>
</br>
I received your kind favor of the 30th of which I was happy to receive for i was very dejected unhappy just about that time after losing all my friends it made me a great deal ligther hearted when i received it for a few words from those we love at home takes a great deal of trouble off ones mind.  but this wont do as i am writing a melencoly letter and it being my birth day too, only think that I am 25 year old to day. The years slip by very quick you know what i told you when I was 26 Em so keep up a good heart i expect that this war will be over before that time and if nothing happens to me before that everything will be all right you spoke about that ladder that we went under about being disappointed you at  a going to mothhaven and me being sick but don’t let such superstition get a hold of you as it is all nonsence as i was sick before i left Miss Whites but i did not like to show it. but that is all over i felt better the second day i was back to camp i was very sick the day i was in washington i never left the house all day long i was afraid i would not be able to go to camp the next day but i went as sick as i was the 38 miles in the stage coach did not help me any. when i arrived in camp the news was anything but agreable to me as i lost 50 of my associates among which was my best friends. the only ones that was left to me was jonny Maguire & Billy Smith i have felt so lonesome ever since i almost wish i had stayed in New York when i was there but i am beginning to be reconciled now if i could but hear from them i would fell a great deal better i believe they have a chance to write once in a while if you should hear any news from Goerge Odell i wish you let me know as soon as it is possible for i am very anxious. i am very glad that you have got over your face ache and you feel first rate. i hope i will fell the same when i go to the city again i think i will be home again this winter if i do i will go to one ball with you if i have to go 20 miles to it. i am very sorry i could not go that night but it was best that we did not go as you would have been sick as well as me.  so jonny Bingham staid away that night he was very considerate of which i am very thankfull to him you say that you went to church and prayed for me i am very glad you did as i think i need some one to do it as i have none to since mother died but you .  you say your folks expect to hear a full account of the battle from me but they have read it all in the papers. but there was a communication from a man styling himself Col. Hincks of the 19th Mass regt in the N.Y. Herald saying that our regt derseted the island which is the most base lies that ever a man told.  as our men did not leave that island till 10 o clock the next day they were taken care of the wounded of the 15th & 20th Mass regt when their own men derseted them as for the man hincks as he styles him self when our Major Bowe as have a man as ever stood went looking through the island for this man Hincks he could not find him for over an hour then he found him safely in bed. the Major asked him what was to be done he said that nothing could be done that night that to wait till morning. that was a nice answer to give as the wounded lay on the island in a hard rain. he is a pretty man to be col of a regt. our Major has called him out to fight a duel for the base lies that he has heaped on him and on our regt. you must excuse this letter for being so long but i felt just like telling you all of which i dont think will interest you.  give my respect to all the family so i will now close this letter by sending my affectionate love to you</br>

Dearest Em.</br>
</br>
I received your kind favour of the 3rd yesterday. you dont no how happy it made me i see you by that little motto that you want me to take you in.  i will be happy to do so. when this war is over so you think that it is the most fortunate thing that ever happened to me. well i think i would be in richmond on in the cold ground before this if i had been here but you see what is to be will be. that was always my motto i guess you will begin to think i was about right. you always sayed it was foolish to talk so. so. george has a recruiting tent and is ord Seagt of which i am very glad as he wont have guard duty to peform. but have full charge of all the companys books. so you went girl like running around the block with you mouth full of water. (Oh Em) i only wish i had been there i would have sung out some name that you never would attempt to do it again. you tell me not to despair well i did despair a little the last two weeks back. but that was not on your account it was for my lost comrades. you need not fear of my going in any engagement for a while. as the company has got two or three different kind of arms and one half of them is broke. i never will lead them to battle. with the arms they have or under our Lieut. Colonel as he dont no enything and is a coward. the man that i love and would follow if i had to go with him a lone is a prisoner in richmond if i should go in battle with out letting you know about it you would not forgive me (Eh.) well we will see about that when the time comes. so you think you think your are boss (hay) well you need not talk as i am my own boss and i boss over 50 men now. as i have had an adition to the company. so you see that if i can boss so many men that i aint afraid of you so you must dispel all idea of some one being over me. i am in very good health and have very good living. and dont sleep on the hard ground any more. the weather is getting very cold out here. i expect we will get the large tents with the stoves in them if we dont the regt will be froze dead some morning. as for me i have a large tent. i will have one of the small sheet iron stove put in it. as they sell them very cheap in the village. so i will be as warm as toast this winter. but that wont be like setting in a house in 19st. along side of a good stove with some one that a fellow; well i wont say no more about it as you wont think i mean it give my respect to all your folks also to jonny Bingham and the Miss Whites. i hope this finds you in the best of health as it leaves me. so with my affectionat love with the answer to all those Kisses returned double fold Au Revoir tell next week.</br>

yours of the 21st came to hand on monday Eve, but as the mail leaves only three times a week reason i did not answer it before. you say it is as good as treat to get a letter from me. but a letter from you out here in the wilds of Maryland is far better than all the treats i could ever give you if i am sick its make me well. if downhearted it makes merry i hope you will excuse that last letter after it was gone i was sorry i sent it to you. if any else should happen to get it. exspecialy anyone we were  accuanted with i should not like it very much. and i hope you will burn it up as soon as you get this. you also state that if you was out here. that you would be a good nurse to me and that you would talk sweet to me. nothing would afford me greater pleasure than to have you here with me but the place is not fit for person of your sociaty. i am beginning to get disgusted withe the head of our regiment as he makes a fool of himself and the regiment too. all the time making blunders, having other regts laughing at us. i heartly wish we could get our beloved Colonel Cogswell back with us again. i would not want to come home inside of the three years but the way that things is working here i dont know how soon i will be back in New York dear Em i dont think i am getting very sentimental as i dont hardly know what the word means. nor i dont think that i would fell you pull that whiskes under my chin as it might hurt. how about that poor fellow that sent his girl home a watch from beaufort do you think that he will ever return. he must have had good luck when he went into that town. but if my girl waits till i go through houses or goes into dead mens pockets for a watch i am afraid she will be very old by that time. i might make her a present if she will only be quiet it wont be before the middle of january as the paymaster wont be along till after the first. so dont call your beau hard names but wait a while and give him a chance as he never had before because he was to many hops and balls for a mechanic. so Walter is in the sutters department it is a pretty hard place for a to fetch a young man up in and if i was Robert Steveson i would stay where he is as he may be somebody. but never will if he goes in the sutters department. as you can learn everything bad and nothing good in it you told Mary White that i sent her my love. and as i did no such a thing you told her a fib. so she thinks your are cut out poor thing. she must think that you could be cast off. but it not so; ha Em; i am very thankfull for sending of me those little paragraphs of our Col. and Major that Col of the 19th regt is afraid to fight. he wants our Major to send him as writing challenge so as to have him cashiered but our Major aint a fool, all i wish that will fight and that our Major put daylight through him. for his backsliding proprentesties if you should see Mrs Capt Graham or Mr Mathewson again i wish you let them know as little as possible about me; as i dont think that either one is a gentelman they have both acted towards me and the rest of my associats in the most strange manner will no more about them two as they are not worth writing about. have sent for a trunk which will sent to me by the first of next week. i was a going to ask you to send me a couple of handercheifs but i thought it would not look very nice so i got my sister in law to send them with the letters E.C. C on it but i would rather have had you do it. you talk of sending me a shovel full of kisses i should not like to take them off of that as they would loose there flavour. i have been in very good health ever since you got that letter i hope that you are enjoying the same blessing. you say that you wanted a long letter and not commence it in the middle of the sheet. i dont know what you mean by that as my letters is longer than yours and it is wrote closer. so please keep my love till i return from the wars. write soon as i am always looking for your letters to me so good bye. till i hear from you as i am ever anxious</br>
</br>
Yours Sincerly</br>

My Dear Emma</br>
</br>
I received your kind favour of the first and was very happy to receive it i was looking for it every mail i had began to think that you had lost the directions or else i had insulted you in my last letter to you but felt so happy when the letter was handed to me if ever you get out of humor again i wish you would wait till you had posted the letters and then you can get as mad as you like. i would like to know what was in it that you did not want me to read i dont think that is very fair as i thought you never kept anything back from me i dont know as i shall tell everything to you any more so will well we will be even on that point i am very sorry that you spent such a lonesome thanksgiven day. i thought more than once of you that day. i believe i took dinner with you last year and i hope will the next I am very sorry your Mother and Louisa was so very say sick i wish to be kindly remmember to them. you also say that your sick and tired of sickness in the house. for same Em to talk so when your relations is ill. what will you do in times to come. if i should happen to be sick. would you go a round the house upsetting everything and with cross looks just because someone was sick. how can you talk so after what you said about nursing me a little while ago. how can i believe you meant it i am very sorry that you sister is so bad as to have the head doctor in city it must be dreadful when a person cant lay in bed when they are sick. you said i might speak to col about you but your just too late as i had an addition to my company to day in the shape of a strapping big irish woman. one of the mens wifes. she could not get along in the city so she pops out here. the husband is tickeled to death to have her here as he expect he will be rich before the is war is over but i aint very well pleased to have her here as i will have to find quarters for her i wish she was out of this camp. she will draw ration as well as the men so there will be more trouble so you charge me double if you had to anything in that line. very well the day will come when you will do it for nothing and do it with pleasure too; Eh Em dont you think so well if you dont get your likeness taken and put in that locket and also mine by time i come to New York i will forgive you as for putting yourself or your likeness in the post Yrip you can please your self. and you cant make me believe that i told you to do it. you give me a cut on the letters that i have wrote to poor fellows parients as if it was not so well i will confess that some them of was to young laidies and widows. will you beleive that (Oh yes i know you will but i cant help it) when any one don so my character i always do something to make them beleive me. you also heard that i was a going to start dancing school (that come from Mrs D) as that was the only one i ever mentioned to if ever i want to get up a yarn and dont want any body to know it i am just a going to mentioned it to a woman. as i know they wont tell any one of it. but i dont think it will pay out here as we would have to transport laidies from New York and Washington. so you were surprised at me sister getting married well i dont wonder  at you a bit as i was not only not only surprised but astonished when i heard of it. you suppose i feel proud in my new brother in law. well i rather think i dont as he never was a favorite of mine and what is more he never will be. you spoke about some cake. dont i wish you may get; also that you would take mine. well i never just as if i was not big enough to take it myself that is if there was any and i rather think there was nary cake. i dont hear any more of the Warren Rifles are they still agoing and is George a going with them. kindly remmember me to all your folks and also to everybody that is what i and somebody else are accuanted with. i am in very good heath at present hopeing that this will find you in as good health accept this from me with my most affectionate love for you.</br>

Dear Emma</br>
</br>
your welcome letter of the 13th arrived here in safety on the 17th.  I was very happy to hear that you was in good health as this leaves me at present.  I sincerly hope that your Sister is not so bad that your fear of loseing her.  the docters thinks she has got the consumption.  I hope you have not got that same docter that she had last summer who thought more about flattering young laides than he did attending to his business.  I wish you would give my respects and well wishes to Louisa for her speedy recover.  you must excuse me for reprimanding you in that letter for what you said about your folks being sick.  as I perfectly know that you did not mean it.  you do me a great wrong by even hinting that I would flirt with young or old laides out here where there is only a few.  and they are seccessionist and as I dont leave camp once in three weeks without its is on a brigade drill up in pooleville.  I never had a chance of forming there acquanses so I will leave you to do all the flirting as you have the chance and I have not.  I accuse no one but Mrs. D. as I never to any one else mentioned of dancing school untill you heard of it.  if there is any young laidies been imported out here.  I have never seem them.  I shall ask leave to go out of camp and try and see them.  for it is quite a curiosty out here to see a young lady.  you think it is too bad that I am not in N.Y. so I could go to Betts hops.  that is last place I would think of going for such places is to tow for a Lieutenant in the army to go to.  but I should like to be home by the 30th of January to go to the fire department Ball.  I am a going to try for it any how.  that is if we are not engaged in battle before that time and then I should have a enough balls to attend you must not be so hard on poor Jonny Bingham because he wont go for to be a soldier as he is very young yet and if he knows any about soldiers fare.  I dont think he will ever enlist what do you think Em.  my sister got married in 18st Methodist Church.  I dont know what will come happen now I never was so surprised in my life when I heard it.  please enjoy yourself as much as you can but keep away from Betts dancing school  I saw his advertisement in the hearld. and I had to laugh for I thought he had debts enough to pay for the two last years.  I dont know what it will amount to this season.  your paper comes regularly every week.  I very thankfull to you for sending it too me I am very happy to hear that you was in good humor as this is wenesday night being that I could not go and see you I thought I could not past the time better than by writing these few lines to you I would rather be a setting by your side than writeing in my tent.  but every one can not do as they like so we have to do our best. but what is the matter with you lately that your letters is so short as there is nothing of importance transpired in camp since I wrote to you last I will close the scribble by sending my respect to the family of Knights and by sending to my affectionate love to one of the daughters you will please answer this soon and a little longer than the last</br>

Dear Em</br>
</br>
Not receiving a letter from you for nearly two weeks.  fearing that you might be sick or your sister was worse or that you had not received my letters that I sent you as your paper the Atlas did not reach me.  I began to fell alarmed that something has happened to you or your folks.  because your letters and paper could not both have gone astray so I sat down and thought for awhile if I had put everything in the letters to insult you but I could not think of anything I thought the best thing that I could would be to write a few lines to see whether you was well or not and whether you recived my letters. I was never was so dissapointed in my life as I was on christmas Eve when you letter did not arrive. as it was due. having nothing to write about and as I feel very anxious about you.  I hope you will answer this as soon as you get it.  hopeing that nothing has happened to you and all of your folks and are enjoying good health as I am at present.  wishing you all a merry christmas and a very happy New Year Em you must excuse the shortness of this letter as I dont feel much like writing to night and I cant find words to put toghether</br>

Jan 28th 1862</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
My dear Emma</br>
</br>
I received your ever welcome letter dated Jan 19th on last Saturday evening.  I was very glad to hear that your was well and hope you will continue to keep so.  this leave me jo enjoying better health than ever.  Em it Seems that your would have give me up on Short notice.  Just think of my feelings when I had not heard from you or received your letters for nearly a month.  the last one was dated Dec 12th I next received three on one night â€“ they were dated. Dec 21st, Jan 1st and 6th.  they were answers to my letters of the 12th, 18th, 28th instead of writing three letters to my one.  you only answered the ones I sent you.  every letter you wrote was an answer to one I sent you. with the exception of the first one I received after leaving you.  I have them Safe.  So you See I can compare the dates to one another.  I received the box that Mrs. G. sent me for my New Years. all Safe and was very thankfull to her for remmembering us poor fellows when So far away. you spoke about Saving that ornament that was on the cake but you are too late for the it has diapeared some time ago.  So Sarah has received a present from her dear jonny and is all the time crowing over it.  well never mind Em.  you chance to crow will come next.  by the next letter I hope the regiment will be payed off.  then you shall have a present worth crowing over.  I will not be able to send the present. but will Send you the material to get and that will just as good.  then you can Suit your self.  never mind what your Sister say about me.  she dont know her own mind a half an hour as she was always as sweet as honey when I was in her company but it seem when I am out of her way She takes pleasure in backbitting me.  if she ever says anything about me good or bad let her tongue run on and say nothing.  she will soon stop it.  the reason she does it is to make you angry.  I think I know what she alludes to by not treating her as a gentleman should.  they were two instances only.  one was done in a very unthoughtfull moment.  and then there when I was in a passion.  but we will let them pass by without bringing up old soars.  for some felt as much as I did after I done it or even when I think of them I would like to get the chance to go to the city to get that new penny which you promise me for writing that short speach about you my dear Em but you have put the finishing touch to it (you tell not to be too sure for I might get shot) if I do that will finish our compact between you and I for if I should come home maimed or disfigured I shall never fulfill or asked you to fulfill anything that has passed between us. or if I should be laid low in the Sacred Soil of Virginia then you will have to look for another Ned as you will have lost yours. by him going to be a bold Soldier boy as providence does everything for the best.  it will do so in our case </br>
</br>
So you think the Army is a long time a moveing well to tell the thru truth it is rather slow but it is all for the best.  the people and you along with them seems to be very anxious to have us commence and butcher each other; it is all very nice to Stay home and wonder why McClelland does not advance but if they were out of here they would see the roads are impassable. the potomac has raised over 20 feet and it has been raining the last three weeks we have had only clear day in that time.  why to Advance is impossible it would be sure death. they are making every preparation to make an advance. we have had orders to see that the men are fully equipped with every thing that is needed our arms is all broke and of no use. the colonel told Gen Stone about it. he says that if we can not use the musket we will have to use the bayonet.  which looks as if he was a going to give the regiment a close quarter engagement. the warren Rifles had better come to the seat of war soon. if they want the pleasure of taking a hand in of the grand Army of the United States. I think that motto you sent me was about the best one that ever I have read. for I believe every word in it. and I am very sorry that I have not motto to answer it. give my respect to all your folks. also to the Misses Whites. tell Mary White that I have not seen her Terry and if I had I would not know him. I should like to know his full name. his company and regiment. then I might come a crossed him I shall have to come to a halt as I have no more news to write about. please accept my sincere love</br>

My dear Em</br>
</br>
little did I think one year ago to night when we was at the W. A. ball. a dancing that I would be in the wilds of Maryland or that I would be Setting alone in a tent a writing to one that I thought I could never leave without seeing her once a week at the least. you can imagine how I feel when I look back to just one year to night when along with you I whirled away in the giddy dance in a large room with a thousand jets of gas burning as I write I look around me it makes me feel Sad instead of that spacious hall. I only see a tent about 8 feet square with one Solitary candle a burning to give me light or else I could not write. it has made me feel lonely and thoughtfull. how I wish I could see one year a head of me. to See what our fates may be. I would give one hundred dollars to be in the city to night. if I had to come away in the morning. it seems like a prison to night to be cooped up here. but away with Such melancholy thoughts. I ought to be ashamed of my self but then one cannot help it especially when one receives a letter from one that he thinks all the world of. when he hears that she is having lots of fun as she calls it and has bought a new pair of Skates. (Oh. how consoling that is to me) well one must not be selfish. but one has to think. and when one does that you can hardly imagine what runs in ones mind. I Shall have to oblique</br>
</br>
I am very happy to state to you my dear that that unworthy lover of yours (E.C.C) has put his foot one step higher on the ladder.  that is he is now a first Lieut in Company C., 42nd Tammany Regt. I suppose it was for his bravery that he was promoted. for he had never seen or been in a battle. any how he has the honor of wearing a bar on each Shoulder. but as ther bars are not very heavy. I can easily carry it if this will only last long enough. I hope I Shall be able to carry two bars on each Shoulder. but I am afraid that Davis & Co will fail. then I would be thrown out of employment. I should not like that to be the case before july</br>
</br>
It is all very nice for you to write out to me now Eddy all I want is you to escort me. but I dont see it that light. for a young lady of your education and Standing in Society. writing to poor fellow such nonsence well if I was there I dont think that you make me got up to the pond with you. I get Walter to go up with me (aint nice to have a brother) but Walter who, you wish I was a Leiut in the city. well I dont there is enough of popinjays Leuit in city. if I was in new york a Leuit $108.00 could not keep me a month.</br>
</br>
I feel very glad that you bought a set of furs for it looks as if you were a sensible good girl as your are. but those horrid Skates. I am afraid that you will break that sweet neck of yours. then I Should never forgive myself.</br>
</br>
The last time I wrote we were about to march  well we did march for three miles in mud over our heads and was made perfect fools.  I never got sold so nice in my life but I dont think I swore any</br>
</br>
The weather still keeps very bad. one day rain the next clear it keeps the camp in mud. it is all mud here and by your letter it is all ice in N.Y. for 2 pages of it is very cold and all about skates.  please give my respects to father, Mother, Louisa, Walter and George and accept my warmest love yourself</br>

</br>
My dear Emma</br>
</br>
your letter dated the 16th was received just five minuets ago it afforded me mush pleasure and Satisfaction in hearing from you.  for we are in a very unsettled condition we have moved our camp up to the Village where we are at present.  but expect to march every day our regt is the only infantry regiment in this Vicinity the rest of of the brigade is with Banks division we expect to go to Washington from there to Centreville. or on Some expedition.  I may have a chance to See your borther we may camp very close together</br>
</br>
That person you Spoke of me has never Mentioned your name to me.  nor I to him.  I Suppose if I was to broach the Subject to him he might tell me a good many things concerning you and other accuaintances of mine.  he has not even Spoke of J. Grahams to me.  he seems to keep everything to himself.  he has no position in the regt yet.  I Suppose and hope he will be captain of my Company</br>
</br>
you Speak about Somebody getting letters and that you wrote two and received no answer.  I dont See how it is for I have answered all your letters promptly.  you need not be in Such a huff about writing to me So often for you have more time to write and do not write to me only when answering me letters.  as for the business you talk about.  I have my hands full ever Since I left New York. for I have been the only officer in the Company. and had every thing to do.  if I was to describe everything that was done between Reveille in the Morning and Tattoo at night you would think I had enough to do.  So Miss Em you think I will not be a Lieut all the days of my life.  I hope not for I Should not like to hold the Same position for life.  I Sincerly hope to be higher in uncle Sams Service.  if not I Should like to Serve him in the Same capacity I now do yes even for a life time.  I would take a position in the regulars to morrow and jump at it if it were offered to me.  but I am afraid there is. no Such good luck in Store for me</br>
</br>
Now really I forgot that I was writing to you My dear Em I thought it was to Some country girl as your term them but you must excuse me this time.  I Shall not So far forget myself while writing this as I did the last</br>
</br>
So My dear you want a young man to inquire about every place he goes to.  dont you know that a young man cannot find out by doing that.  have you not went to places and told me if you know that it was a going to be the way it was you would have went.  it never was my fault for I always inquired about Such places if I had the chance. another a lady has no right to go every place a man goes to</br>
</br>
I Shall have to bring this to close for I have nothing to write about.  only we have got our new arms and pretty little peices there are to.  they are Springfeild Rifle 1861 make.  So we are will to march anywhere.  I hope before this reaches you we will be far away from here.  for I am Sick and tired of this place.  we have been in this vicinity over eight months.  I understand Since writing the above our brigade is ordered to Washington if that is only true.  we will join them there.</br>
</br>
give my respects to all and please accept my Sincere love.  good night</br>

we left poolsville last Sunday where bound I cannot Say only that we go to fortress Monroe whether we go on an expedition or not I am perfectly ignorant.  we Stopped at Washington two nights.  just before we left your brother came on board to See me  he looks very well and hearty.  I have had a beautifull  Sail down the potomac river.  we went into the bay this morning but had to put back on account of the roughness of the Sea and are at anchor off of point lookout waiting for Smooth water.  we expect to be at the fort to morrow morning if the weather will permit.  if not we will have to lay to on board the boat.  this boat is not one of the Safest boats in the world.  it is an old Hudson river boat that has Seen over 20 Summers.  She is very heavelly laden and would be very apt to break in two if we Should run out to Sea in rough weather.  </br>

your ever welcome letter dated the 27th reached me last night it was just 10 days coming So you See it may only take one day to go to Washington and of course it takes longer to a place a few miles further on expecially when there is nothing but a Stage coach running and that runs only every three days. I have always wrote promptly. you must not expect letters So often now for we have no way of Sending them until we take Yorktown which we will do in the course of to day or a few days at the fartherest. we are now trowing shells at each other by the of way of compliments I expect to have bloody work to day we all have our mucians carring letters to carry off the wounded McClelland is at the head of our column. we have been in this position for two days. I understand that we have to capture one hundred guns before we take Yorktown at which place the enemy is in very Strong force they have burned every due dwelling that is of worth burning. in the city of Hampton there is one Solitary house Standing. the rest have been burned. at Big Bethel they Splendid fortifications and could have hold it against almost any fort force. I must stop writing for the regt is falling in to march. accept my Sincere and affecionate love</br>

I have not arrived in Richmond yet. one more battle like the one on Saturday & Sunday will bring me there Em it was dredfull.  the enemy made an attack with there whole force on Gen Casey division which made a complete Slaughter of his troops. driven him away from his camp and capturing his battries. very few of what was in the battle escaped with ther lives it was heart Sickning to See the car loads of wounded. every day passing down to the white house. if it had not been for Sedgwicks division they would have captured the rail road bridge which I am Stationed at. it being at that time the only bridge that we could transport provision to the troops on the other Side of the chickhommia river. the heavy rains had washed all other means of transportation away there was another bridge about a mile up the river called grape Vine bridge by which our division got across. but not without getting a good ducking that is the last part of the division they had to carry the arttilery over. men wading to very near their necks in water. our regt was not in the Action. they are three company guarding the rain road from White house to Meadow Bridge. that leaving only Seven Small company left (we number olny about 550 fighting men) but they had plenty to do getting the guns and propping up the bridge. they were Still at it yesterday. our loss was very heavy but that of the enemy was enormous. in Some places they layed filed up 4 on top of one another. I have Seen as much as twelve trains from ten to twelve cars each fairly loaded with the wounded of our own troops I Saw many a one with their Arms and legs Sawed off.  some with their eyes Shot out. there was one col had his horse knocked down. his coat torn off his back. he and he picked up for dead and carried off the field. next morning he was taken to Dispatch Station when Dr McClellan (Gen McClellan brother) felt of his pulse and felt them beat. he went to work and brought the Col back to life. when the col. asked where his regt was and Started to join on the instant and is now doing duty.</br>
</br>
I do not know what to think of what your folks Said of me. no Em I dont care either as long as you know how it is. I think we are both old enough to manage our own affairs. just if I could not get rid of you if I wanted to without going to the war I wonder if all young men came out to get rid of Some one. did your Brother George. but then Em it is just as I expected and told you before I came away. I feel Sorry for you my dear Em for it places you in a delicate position but we will trust in the lord and we will Surprise Some folks after this war is over or my name is not Eddy. that is if I am not disabled. Some folks may alter there opinion about me in regards to their daughter. I think you are getting worse Since I left as you Seem to be a better. I will use your quotation what you use to Say to me only the reverse. a lady Should never buy anything when alone that is in the way of refreshments that She would not ask for when accompanyed by a gentlemen. So you See I Still disaprove of it I think when I get back to New York that I Shall get married and move South. then we so as to keep friends to all my own relations as well as my wifes. what do you think Em. I Shall bring this letter to a close. hoping this will find you in good health as I am at present. I Shall expect you to answer this immediately and accept my sincere and true love</br>

Truly yours</br>

My Dear Em.</br>
</br>
Your welcome letter dated the 10th was received by me this evening with much joy for it is about 8. O clock on Saturday evening and I was a wondering how 8th avenue looked. and if you was promanading up it. while I am awaiting for a forlorn hope. I do not understand what you mean by filling a whole Sheet of what I belong to. I did not think it worth while writing about a battle when I was not in to it. I was near enough to it that is fact and yet I was Still nearer last night (friday). there was the boldest attempt made by the rebels last night that ever was heared of in this war or any other at dusk last night there was a band of about 100 gurrillas. made an attack on Tunstalls Station capturing 1 captain 1 Lieut and eight men belonging to our regiment. partially burning two bridges and destroying every thing they could find. they also destoyed a train of waggons numbering in all thirty two. when the train of cars was passing. they commanded the engineer to Stop the train. he Seeing they were rebels opened the throttle valve and let the engine have full Speed. when the rebels fired at him and the train killing three men and wounding quiet a number. the engineer and fireman escaping. but the balls riddle the engine house.  but how they got by our lines and got in the rear of us I have not ascertained. there Seem to be poor management Some where. we have got our troops Scouring the country but I am afraid it is of no use. I think the bird has flown flew.  I am not Sure wether our boys are killed or taking prisoners. I do not know what gurrillas bands will do with prisoners. there is no news from the front we dont know what minuet. they will make a dash at the long rail road bridge if they burn it our Supplies will be cut off. but we are on the look out for it as we expect it and intend to give them a warm reception</br>
</br>
I am very sorry that my last letter reached you for the bull I made in it after I had Sent it to mail.  I Saw my mistake in reading your letter. I could not understand it in my first or Second reading. but the third time I felt very cheap after writing what I did now I want to know who it is that is medling with my affairs and I do not want you to make any excuse about telling me who it is. I am very glad to hear of your brother getting along So well. he has my best wishes and I hope he Succeeds in getting his commission. I think if you witness Such a Sight as the battle field of fair oaks you would never want to See another dead person. I could give you accounts of it that would make your blood run cold I dont know but that it is making me hard hearted.  but that will all pass away when I get amongst the fair Sex once more. dont you think So your brother George may be out this way as the troops are coming from all directions. I thought the army was large enough but I See they want more. I think the next fight in front of Richmond will be the last general engagement and there will be nothing but gurrilla war fare which is worse I am in excellant health not knowing what minuet I may Stop a ball by the way things look here. I See by your letter that you are in good health hoping that you continue So. So I will now Stop this by asking you to accept my warmest and most Sincere love</br>

Dear Emma</br>
</br>
Yours dated the 20th was received with much pleasure as it brings news of your good health in which I am very much interested in. I am very Sorry to hear that you have left the Tract house and gone to that miserable place in Franklin Street.  as your former place was one that any respectable young lady need not be ashamed off. but that place where you are now. I can Say I think much of. but then a person must live. and you could not keep your Self in Shoe leather. well Em I do pity you. if I thought you would not be insulted. I would Send you on enough to keep you in that article. but it is a delecate thing to give Shoes to lady. I am very Sorry to hear of your father being out of work So long. I Sincerly hope that he may get work again before this reaches you and that you will be back in your old place again. for you will Soon get tired of the place you are in; I think; I am pretty certain that you will not accompany the Same young that you did last fourth of july to See the fire works. at the Same time nothing would give him more pleasure than to take you there and he does not think he will be in Richmond by that time. if I never get a leave of absence to go home untill I play Sick.  I dont think I will ever go home. at the Same time I have a new Suit which has been waiting for me for over four weeks. which I would like to Sport in New York for about 10 days.  I will not want them until we take richmond. I am off the rail road and have been to the front Since Saturday night without a tent which is not very pleasant. for it rained all day yesterday. only think not five miles from a large city and can not go to it.  we are having very hard times of here.  I have not Since I have been here had two hours rest at one time night or day. the enemy  is So close that we have to lay on our accoutrements not even allowed to take our belts off. and every Shot that is fired by the pickets in front of us. we have to fall in. Standing from a half an hour up to three not even allowed to Sit down. well we have to. to guard against Surprise party. I am only learning wiat Soldiering is now.</br>
</br>
I think it is my affair as they Said I went to the war to get clear of you. a nice place to go to really. but enough about that all I want is the name Em. the name</br>
</br>
I Shall bring this to a close for the want of any more news. my respects to your father, Mother Brothers and your Sister Louise and accept my best and only love. from your loving and devoted</br>

My dear Em.</br>
</br>
I received your letter dated July 13th yesterday which gave me much satisfaction and pleasure to hear of you being well and by its tone in good spirits. as I happy to Say that leaves me the Same with one exception my hand is pretty sore but will be all right in a day or two.  I am very Sorry to hear of your Spending Such a miserable fourth of july and me the cause of it too.  if you keep looking at 23rd men (as you call them) all day long. I am afraid you will soon forget your Soldier boy.  you say you wish that Wallaces band were playing for the troops to come home. well if this war was Settled I would wish the Same wish for. I have Seen enough of Soldiering to last me for some time. but as long as my country needs me in crushing this unatural rebbellion. So long shall I continue to serve in the army. there is only one thing that I wish the goverment would do and it would save time. blood and treasure. also bring bring cowards from their mamama Mothers apron Strings, that is to draft every single man in the north and put muskets in their hands and Send them here.  for here is the place for them. and it must be done immediatly we have been playing too long which is now stopped and we must strike the fatal blow before the first of October. as the roads after that time will again be impassable to draw our Stores and Seige guns if Richmond is not taken before then. it will not be taken for another six months. if this army has to wait So long. there will be no army left. they would desert every chance they got and I would not blame them. I think I would almost go home myself. if I had my way. I would hang every abolisitionist in the north. which would do more to Settle our troubles than 50,000 bayonets here. Em. I am a going to try and get a captaincy in of one of the new regts that are raising in the city. well Em what do you Say. dont think it would be a good chance for a furlough and a raise but then if I get my just dues I will get the raise here. you must not believe half of what the Sunday Mercury Says. as for peace. I have to laugh when I hear the word. the enemy has had new life put into them. Since the retreat of the army of the potomac. if it had not been for the clear working of our Generals and the bravery of the Soldiers. they would have taken Sumners and Heinztmans corps as it was we were Surrounded on Monday June 30th and had to fight our way through. I give great pl praise to the soldiers.  but am Sorry to Say that some officers acted like Cowards. the retreat was a great victory to us for one reason that is if we had Stayed two weeks more in the trenches before richmond we would not have had 25,000 effective men the weather is dreadfull but warm I mean it is just as much as the men can Stand. Ice cream would go like hot cakes here. the rebels claim great victorys.  well So they can. for they have got rid of a terrible enemy which has threatened the city for some time. and would have been there if we had got what we wanted, reinforcements; then the Summer company and may be the war would have been ended Ha. Ha. how I would like to be Captain of a Company of female Lous. Lous and have you for my first Lieut how would that do. for they would have to have a man at their head. for women cannot get along where they are So the fire department is filling up. I hope the common council passes a law allowing not of only married men to join. the cowards to join the department now. one year ago they were foremost in running it down. I Suppose the cry will be after this war was over that nothing the Volunteers were all loafers. the way it was after Mexico. well that is the way with the world. I wayed myself this morning. weighing 159 lbs. just a year ago to day I left great Neck. long Island I then weighed 147 lbs. Showing how much a Soldiers life agrees with me and I never went through. So much hard times putting my whole life together. as I have Since I left Poolesville. one year to day it Seems to be three. how I Should like to drop in New York to day. if I would not have a glorious time for twenty four hours. I never felt So much like going home. as I have this last week. I would give 50 dollars to have 10 days in the city. but it cannot be did. as I have not much more room and no more news. I Shall bring this to a close by asking you to accept my Sincere and affectionate love from your ever truly </br>

My Dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your letter dated July 11th was received with much pleasure and Satisfaction by me. for I am always anxiously looking for your letters you need not be afraid of them not reaching me if you direction the way you always do. without I happen to Stop something. then I would hardly receive it. from all accounts that Mass meeting at Union Square was a failure. and was nothing more or less than a black abolition mob. which was a disgrace to the old empire city.  I believe you Em. when you Say the men that is left are all cowards. if they were not we would have the presidents called filled up and a large home guard ready for an emergency. which we want for the South has made another levey for troops between the ages of 16 X 45. their first levy was between 18 and 35.  I would give a hundred dollars to See them draft and me having the pleasure to do some of the drafting as you Say rich and poor it would make no difference to me.  I am very happy to hear of Some one doing Something for the wounded Soldiers at home it is a pity that we cannot take better care of our sick and wounded here in the field.  there is not a day goes over my heard but what I hear a volley fired over Some poor fellow who has gone to that home from whence no traveler returns.  Some days as many as sic six.</br>
</br>
You want me to hurry up and come home.  Oh how I Should like See home you Say your are tired of working.  I hope you do not expect to lead a lazy life after I get home.  you also think I have got lots of money.  but I dont See it.  it cost an officer almost all his Salary for clothes and food and to keep up appearances. for it is a gay life.  when I was first an officer I thought Sure I was agoing to get rich but I found out different.  of course I have layed out a little for a rainy day.  between 3 & 4 hundred dollars. there is a little over Seventy-five (75) dollars worth of clothing Somewhere between here and fortress Monroe or New York it was Sent but has not arrived. you would like to find out how Bill Richardson knows you. well really I can not Say being that I am over 400 hundred miles from there you out to know. you have lived for Some time next door to him Em I am getting to an old man and losing all my teeth.  I pulled two and broke one front one. postage Stamps is good change.  when you get over run them why you could send a few out here as generally they are very Scarce here. has your father got to work yet.  let me know whether George is in Gen Popes army. if he is he will Soon See active Service my complements to him. I should very much like to correspond with him.  So as to be posted about movements of where he is. I Still enjoy excellant health hoping this will find you the Same.

My Dear Em</br>
</br>
Your welcome letter was duly received last evening.  I am Surprised to See that there is one part of my last letter you do not understand.  for it answered your letter that I received it was this. you Said you were afraid to write to me. for fear it would not reach me. and my answer was that their was no danger of your letters not reaching me if you directed them the Same as you always do. without I happened to stop Something. then I would hardly receive it. what I meant by that was that I might get Shot hoping that above is fully explained to your Satisfaction.  I will now ask you to explain to me. what is meant by the words. I guess Eddy that you that you must be answering Somebodys else letters besides mine).  I can not understand them.  So you dont understand the idea of a young man keeping up appearence here I tell you Em. that this is the place for a young man especially an officer. to keep up his appearences and dignity. more So here than in the city of N.Y. it has to be done here.  it is a necessity.  the Country nor the goverment would not have an officer in its ranks.  that would degrade himself you Say you do not know what I will do when I come back.  I will be So lazy. well I will thank you for your opinion of me and the rest of the Soldiers. if you only knew of one half of the hard work that this army has had. you would never mention the word lazy to one of them again. for instance. we left camp last Monday night at 6. O clock and marched Steady untill daylight.  rested two hours and Started of again not Stopping untill we Came to rebels on Malvern hill who Skedaddle as Soon as they Seen us we gave chase. but was no use. when we came backe to the hill about 12. resting under the broilling hot Sun and Sleeping at night without Shelter for that day and the next untill 12 O clock at night when we heard that the rebels were Coming in great force 75.000 Strong. then it was our turn to Skedaddle and so we did in quick time untill an hour after daylight. when we reached camp. now if there is any harder work than that. I Should like to know what it is.  I do not think I am very extravagant nor have I Spent money foolishly.  I am very you Sorry you think So.  I have had a great many things to get after I was an officer.  I also had other things to do just at that time which took Considerable money and it is only latley I Sent any home. when the proper time comes for you to know what it was then I will tell but not by letter you also Say that I will never do for a poor girl.  I am very Sorry for that but I think different there was is one thing Sure I Shall never marry a rich one if a poor one will not have me why then I Suppose I Shall Stay Single. as I have alway Said I Should be very Sorry to take a young lady out of her home and put her in a worse one.  I rather think that you do me great injustice by alluding to my extravagant expenditures without knowing the circumstances.  which I Shall explain fully to your Satisfaction.  if I ever reach home but never by mail.  I am not led astray as you please to term it. nor do I intend to be you Spoke a deal of truth about a saying of mine that I went out too much and could not Save anything but I have Started an account with the bank now and Shall go as far as with it as I can notwithstanding I am not all the time.  I am very glad to hear that other call of the Presidents for 300.000 more besides the first.  they are to be drafted.  I am afraid that it will Cause a riot in the city but we must have the men.</br>
</br>
I Still enjoy excellant health.  hoping this find you the Same.  I remain with much respect and love yours as Ever</br>

</br>
Your kind and ever welcome letter has just arrived.  I am very happy to hear that you were enjoying good health.  my resignation was not accepted. but was Sent back with a Severe reprimand. there was only two out of the 17 accepted they were the Lt Col and Major. it was the first reprimand that ever I received Since I have been a Soldier. but I did not mind this one. for I felt perfectly justified in doing what I did and will do the Same thing over if Gov Morgan persist in Sending incompetant men here to command experienced men you tell me to keep up in good heart I never had So much resolution to do anything so I have now and I am looking forward to the better days that are coming. you want to know how we Stand it here. it is pretty tough and is killing men every day. but your humble Servent had been very fortunate.  So far. as I have not had the Sligtest Slightest indications of fever or any of the other numerous camp diseases</br>
</br>
We leave these gay and festive Seens for a more healthy one. we march to day at two O clock. but where I cannot Say I think we go to Popes army. for the order reads that we (Sumner Corps) go on temporary Service any how it is going to be a long tramp for we have two day rations in havesack and four in waggons.  our baggage and the men knapsacks are to be carried by transports.  So you need not answer this untill you hear from me.  which I will be a week from now and it will be from fortress Monroe for we will have to take transports there to take us to our destination is just the Same all over the army about men deserting and I do blame the men for it. when they See inexperienced boys Sent here to Command by the Gov after they have done all the hard work</br>
</br>
You have no idea of a thunder Storm in this warm climate. if the warm weather is taking the fat off of you up there what would it do here but Em you can Share a little flesh. from what you Say your  are pretty Stout. well there is no new at all only I Still enjoy good health and thats no news.  my respect to all the folk and accept my best wishes and Sincere love</br>

having a few Spare moment I take the opportunity to address you a few lines to let you that I have arrived Safe and well after a tedious march down the penninsula which tooks Seven day to do it.  we left Harrisons landing last Saturday arriving here yesterday passing through Williamsburg and Yorktown it beats all the marches that I have been through. when I get home I will think nothing of takeing a walk with you up to central park from there down Broadway to Taylors and back. our (Sumners) corps brought up the rear. the enemy never Showing themselves</br>
</br>
in the last four months we have trudged and worked our way up one Side and down the other of this infernal penninsula without accomplishing any thing; I am wrong we did accomplish some thing. wehave Spent Millions of treasure and lost thousands of lives and ruined many a mans healths. So that he will never be fit for any thing. yes we have accomplished the ruin of the finest body of men that ever left the States. now we find our selves going back to where we came from.  I am getting tired of the work and almost wish I was out of the army.  I dont like the retreat of this fine army.  I feel very Sore about the way we are leaving this peninsula a year ago we were nearer crushing the rebbellion than we are to day we are Commencing the play all over again for it has been nothing a play it is a enough to descourage men instead of making fighting men of them.  I hope that Gen Halleck now that he is in Command of the forces of United States. will push this thing ahead. for we have been fooling long enough. either crush it or give the South their independance.  I know it is wrong for me to mention the word independance and South together but I cannot help it when I look back and See when we were within five miles of Richmond and had to turn our backs on to it.  instead of entering the city. when we came here last april we are were all confident of taking richmond before the fourth of july. but we were dissapointed and had to leave just before that glorious day. we leave to day in transports for acquia creek which Seems to be our destination. I Shall bring this to a close as the men are falling in for inspection. hoping this will find you enjoying good health accept my best respect and Sincere love from</br>

My dear Em</br>
</br>
It was with much pleasure and Satisfaction that I received your letter dated the 1st for I have not had a letter from you or any of my folks in Some time for we are on the march and letters dont reach us every day.  we have only Stopped here for a few hours rest the enemy are in front of us the reason I say so is that our ?sance  were Shelling the woods as they went along this morning and at one time we were drawn up in a line of battle.  which looks as if we would have a Sight of the enemy before night.  I hope so anyhow for I am getting tired of running away and at other times following the enemy up for that will never end the war.  the only way known is to attack and fight it out and if they whip us why then give them their independence you may well Say that half of our army is fighting for money and theirs is of love of the Cowards that ever drew the breath of life. it is Shamefull to See them going in the direction of Washington instead of to the field of battle.  little did I think a year ago that I would be in this part of the Country with the enemy I was in hopes that it would be ended and me home before this.  when I get out of this box. I dont think it I Shall try it over without there is an enemy invading New York State if they would only give us a little less marching and a little more fighting. they would not lose as many men as they do.  now that the rebels are invading the North and we will have to drive them back or they get into Baltimore.  I wish they would make a dash on Washington then it would wake us up.  but Gen McClelland has got Command of the whole army and Banks is in command around Washington So you may expect to hear of Some work going on</br>
</br>
I am very glad to hear of Sergt Maguire getting home. as he was very Sick and from accounts is no better as far as Sergt Smith when last I heard of her  was at New port News.  I have heard that he was in the hospital at philadelphia and was gaining health and I hope to hear of him in the city Soon.  I guess Maguire must be mistaken about being as broad as i am long I know I am pretty Stout but not quiet as bad as that</br>
</br>
As far as a furlough it is a thing not to be thought off while the Country is in the State it is at present.  I Should like to get one very much and Shall as Soon as there is a chance</br>
</br>
I am very glad to hear that George came out of that battle Safe and I think he was lucky to get off with a whole Skin to Say nothing of losing a Shirt.  I was in the last and third line of battle just before the retreat.  please give my Complements to George also my best Wishes and hope that the will soon get this Commission as a Lieut.  I shall close hoping to hear from you Soon.  my respects to all your folks and accept my Sincere love and best wishes to find you enjoying good health as I do at present and excuse the blob as it is a raining and have no place to write under. from yours</br>

Having a few moments to Spare I thought you would like to hear from me. for I know it would please me very much to have a letter from you for it is Some time Since I have heard from you.  I Saw your Brother George the day before the battle but not Since if we had Stopped there I Should went and inquired where his brigade was and found out if he was Safe.  I wish you would let me know about him in your return of mail he looked as if he had Seen hard times like us all.  I hope he has come out of that battle Safe. for I think any man a lucky man to come out of the engagement unhurt.  I dont See how I escaped it.  for they dropped all around me.  my Company went in to that engagement with 24 Strong when it came out I had one Sergt and 4 men a big Company was it not.  our loss was 1 capt poor Charley Macpherson and 5 men killed.  2 missing.  13 wounded.  the battle ground was a horrible Sight it is too horrible to mention.  I had a chance to Set See it all for I asked permission to go and bury the dead of our regt and it was granted.  the field was covered with the dead of both Sides who had died in almost every position.  we left the battle field last monday night morning arriving opposite harper Ferry when we had the pleasure of fording the potomac river which was knee deep it was here where the rebels destroyed a great deal of property. they blow up the rail road which from the appearance of what was left of the Stone and iron peirs was a most beautifull Structure they also blew up our pontoon bridge which the Traitor Miles had thrown across we are now encamped on the ground that he surrended.  the inhabitants here Say he could have held the place for two weeks longer.  put it was a put up job an he Surrended before he had lost 20 men in killed.  it was an awfull thing for us. as Jackson as Soon as he took the place.  Started off to reinforce the rebel army in front of us leaving one brigade to destroy the property here which they did Successibly we have got troops on both Maryland & Louden heights So there is no fear of the enemy of attacking as by the way our troops are arriving here I think we will likely to attack the enemy before a great while</br>
</br>
Em it was just the hottest place that ever I was in and never want to get in the Same fix.  it was terrible to See my friends fall around me and not do any thing for them. not even bidding them good bye or Speaking a word to them.  I must close this letter for the want of Some thing to put in it.  My respects to all the folk and accept my Sincer and affectionate and love hoping that this may fine you in good Spirits and health as it leaves me</br>
</br>
I remain as Ever</br>

Truly Yours</br>

You can not imagine how thankfull and pleased I was at receiving your prompt and speedy letter of the 6th and I Shall be as prompt in return.  if you only know how anxiously I looked for your letters you would not hesitate a minuet in Answering.  as for going home I would give just one months pay. to be there for twenty days in jan or febuary.  but Still as you Say. we cannot speak with our tounges tongues but we ought to be very thankfull to correspond So regular and look forward to the day when we can be together once more.  I Should very much liked to have been walking through Canals Street when that darn nigger Shove up against you.  excuse me for swearing.  well I will not say what I would do.  but I think he would not be likely to shove against another lady from all accounts they will take the upper hand of the whites.  especially if that republican party has there way this election.  I wish they would let the army vote.  there would be different times.   but that is enough about niggers  at the same time I am partially in favor of Old Abes proclamation as it will go a great way in Settling this infernal rebellion.  but it places us Officers in a very bad box. as the rebs will put to death every one they catch of us. but let them do there worst.  no Em. I never want to be a paroled prisoner.  I have got over my Sickness  it did not amount to any thing but I have a bile on my ankle which keeps me to my tent as I can not wear a Shoe the regt is on picket and I am alone in Camp.  it is the first time the regt has been on duty with out me and I am rather lonesome and you say you would have to nurse me what would I give to have you here to day.  all by our Selves would we have a chat you Say you think just as much of me as if I was going regular to See you.  Why Shouldnâ€™t you.  I think more of you than when I left and keep longing to See you by day and dreaming by night.  the idea of a young lady thinking less of a young man because he is absent to war about one year.  I Should not think much of a lady affe whose affectionalles was as lights as that and any young man would be lucky to get clear of any Such lady of Course.  I would rather be visiting you that Setting here hundreds of miles away writing to you for I could Say a great many things that I would not put on paper.  you would not be half as glad as I would if I could only drop in your house I think it would be me that would not know what to do with myself.  why the thoughts make me mad. to get back into Civilization among relations and friends.  you could not imagine the joy why I go Crazy for 24 hours. hoping that it will fall to my lot to have the chance this winter.  my health is very good with the exception of the foot.  hoping this will find you in good health and spirits and give my respects to all your folks hoping they are all well. and take my advice keep clear of the black moaks as you call them for it dont look nice to See a lady out temper in the streets.  for it is there they generaly have on their Sweetest Smiles.  please excuse me for this advice and hoping to have the pleasure of Seeing you before long  I will close with much respect and Sincere love</br>

My dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your ever welcome letter dated Oct 22nd.  I received last evening.  I was very glad to hear that you were in good health. you think because I went with you to see a prossession once that I would do it again.  No, Em I have seen processions enough to last me for some time the very Sight of one will be enough to make me turn around and go the other way.  So you think I put on airs because I am an officer.  I donâ€™t think I do and if I did, whos got a better right.  I think I will Continue to wear the Moustaches and pay the tax.  What do you think Em.  Will it pay.  So you have  been out to the country.  I am glad to hear it and hope you enjoyed yourself.  So you went out a riding with a married man.  Oh Em thatâ€™s awfull. worse than going with a young man.  but then your are jokeing when you say he was married.  you must think I get jealous very easy.  I think a man who would get jealous at Small trifles like that. would be a big fool. especially when he has and is a way for So long a time.  I understood that Maguire was quiet well. and has been to as many as three balls in one week.  if he is not back in ten days. I Shall drop him from the rolls. and place him on the list of deserters.  he must not think he can play it on me. if he had been here I would have had him recommended for a commission.  I hope the draft does Commence on the 10th.  </br>
</br>
I am very Sorry that you went and bought a new hat and Cloak all for nothing.  I Shall not say when I am Coming home any more. for I have expecting to go home for the last four months and aint been there already.  but when I do get there. you will be Sure to see me. as Soon as I get there even if I arrive at three o clock in the morning you talk about Cold weather.  you aught to be on the top of these heights when the wind blows.  I tell you it is terrible you mentioned balls in your letter but I think I have attended enough balls in the last twelve months for to satisfy me but at the Same time I Should like to attend to one with you in the appollo or Academy of Music.  John Lindsey is not home.  I See him here not a week ago.  there is a great time here on account of the government allowing the volunteers. to leave their regts and enlist in the regular Service. which is not hardly right. as great many men has Spent all their money to raise their Company and now these very men Can leave. and join the regular Service after receiving all the bounty.  I wish they would take about 75 men from this regt then we would stand a good chance to be mustered out the Service of the United States.  I am glad to hear that Louisa is getting better.  my Compliments and best wishes to her all also my best respects to father, mother and walter.  So I shall close with much love and respects to you.  I Still remain</br>
</br>
Truly yours</br>

Your ever welcome letter dated Oct 30th was received with great pleasure while I was on the March.  what Made it more pleasant was that it was that it arrived on my birth day.  I am very glad to hear that George has been home I only wish I had been along with him.  but my time has not come yet but is too come.  when I can not Say. for we are marching On every day and are now at Ashbeys Gap near the above place.  which is a very pretty village. and lots of gals who are not Union to a Man but hate the Sight of the Union Soldiers.  I do not think we will Stay here more than a day or two at the fartherest.  thats right Em go your Self and hurrah for Seymore who I hope and respect is elected before this</br>
</br>
So you would get jealous if I took a Married Woman out.  No Em it would only be a married woman and her husband might be along. but you were only jokeing and not Real. about what you would do in the above Case.  your good and loverable disposition and tenderness of heart would not allow you to take away what god giveth.  I dont think that there will be any riot when the draft take place in the City.  if it does it Can be easy put down. at the Start.</br>
</br>
we have beautiful moonlight nights for the last week. the days are Splendid. just right for marching. but the nights are rather Cold for bivowacking without tents.  our trains never Catch us untill the next morning.  then we are ready to Start again.  you ought to know what kind of remark you would get from that So Called gentleman.  please give George my Compliments and best wishes if he is home tell him he may expect to hear of the army doing Something before long.  that beats Antietam.  that is if the enemy will Stand and give battle a Suitable distance from Richmond.  if not why we will winter around Winchester then for Richmond in the Spring give Louisa my best respects hoping that this will find her health better also my respects to all your folks.  I now will conclude by hoping this will find you in the best of health. as it leaves me also accept my best and true love.  I remain</br>

I   have just received your long looked for and welcome letter.  I have been anxiously waiting for it.  I would have wrote before but we have had So much marching to do.  that this is the first oppertunity that I have had to write. in fact I have not time now for we have just come in Camp and it is now 8. O clock and after bed time.  if I may So term it.  the rain is Coming down in torrents.  but hope it will clear up before morning as the regts goes on picket to morrow at nine O clock.  the weather has been very favourable for our business with the exception of one day Snow on the 9th it is with deep regret that I announce the death of Geo. W. Odell he died very Sudenly while we were at wairrenton.  I had him buried in the church yard at that place with a cristian and a Soldiers burial.  the taken away of McClellan from us is an outrage on the american people.  I dont wish any one any harm. but I could look on with pleasure. to See those who had him taken away. tortured.  I glory in being a democrat and would rather be an Irishman than a â€“ black republican. the army was wild when they heard of his removal.  I wish you could have Seen the reception he got when taking leave of his troops.  Such cheering and firing of artillery were never heard before on this Continent. not even in the field of battle after he had gone.  there was a terrible gloom over the whole army.  old Abe and his black republicans friends received many a blessing and do Still.  they like Burnside very well.  but he is no Such man as little Mac. there is no one that can fill his place.  we are very much afraid that they will Send Fremont here over Burside if they do. the war is over and the Southern Confedercy a goverment.  Jack Lindsey left the day after I Seen him.  I am in the right grand division of the army commanded by Gen Sumner. Gen Couch is Command of our (2) army Corps.  Gen Howard in Command of our division.  you may expect to hear of another brush before many days.  we are on one Side of the river they on the other within Speaking distance.  our guns ove Cover Fredricksburg. and we must go on the other Side fight or no fight just a Secesh wishes.  well if you wil not believe me I can not help it you know that I would not fall in love with Secesh.  when I have got Union at home I think George has had a pretty long forlough.  bully for him.  I Should like one of the Same Sort. but I am afraid I will not See it. for I am bound by the way of richmond once more.  I have Jackson Guard enough here.  I am very Sorry to hear that Louisa so So Sick also to hear of father being out especially in the winter as every thing is So dull.  it always makes me happy to hear of you enjoying Such good health.  I dont hardly think that your worring about me makes you thin.  it may be So.  I cant Say.  my best respects to your father, mother, George, Louisa and Walt. and accept my best love.  I remain </br>

My dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your letter dated Nov 20th had just Came to hand.  I can assure you that it was received with much pleasure.  as your letters always does.</br>
</br>
The weather has been middling Cold but not to make it uncomfortable yet as this is the last day of November I expect old jack frost will advance on us and do us more harm than the rebs will.  we have not crossed over to Fredericksburg yet.  what makes the delay I cannot Say.  we have been looking over  these for the last 12 days it Seems to be a very nice city.  I Should like to go over to church this morning but Circumstances will not admit of it.  Richmond is only Sixty miles from it.  a matter of about four days march that is if there is no obstacles in the way like a longstreet a big Hill or a Stonewall but then we might get on the Lee Side of them.  I am thinking that Burnside will not eat his christmas nor Eddy his in New York.  not but what both of us Should be pleased to So.  you need not expect to See me unless I get wounded.  for that is the only way to get a leave of absence. and I dont care about get one that way.  G. Odell died of the heart desease for he Sent for a paper a Second before.  I am the only one that is left of the old boys that is if Maguire does not come out.  I did not think you was So interested in Robert Crawford affairs.  or I must assuredly have wrote to you whe he Skedaddled.  so you think Maguire is right to not come.  I thought you was more patriotic than what your are.  I myself think that any young man who is well and able and does not come out to the war. ought not to be countnanced by any young lady and any young lady who does contenance Such you men.  I think very little of them.  for this reason.  that if they would come out th here.  this rebbellion would be at an end.  but as long as Such lacy loafers and beats hang around our citys and towns.  just So long will this war Continue.  I know very well that they can enjoy themselves North a great deal better than if they were in the sunny South as Some people terms it.  that affair of poor Jeanie Anderson was shocking and terrible.  it just as I expected when I left New York.  I told Miss Anderson and Harriet Towner when I came away that to be very Shy of Gus Simms.  for I knew him perfectly. but the poor girl was infatuated with him and would listen to nothing  She thought he was a perfect god.  I hope they String him up with out a jury.  but I See he is to be used as a witness in the case.  that is the way with our laws.  the guilty always escapes wer we are the 2nd Army Corps.  but the right of the grand Army of the potomac</br>
</br>
if I went home you Seem to think that you will occupy the most of my time.  well I dont know but what you would . but then I Should have to tare myself away and visit my friends and accuantance.  if I do come home I will promise you that you will See enough of me So adieu my dear Emma let me hear from you Soon. and accept the assurance of my Sincere regards and I Shall ever remain your affectionate and loving</br>

Your ever welcome letter of the 9th Came to hand on the 15th while we were at Fredericksburg.  I wrote you a letter on the 11th from that place.  little did I think that it would turn out as disastrous as it has done.  it is by far the worse reverse that has ever happened to our Cause.  our Corps has Suffered terrible it loss is over 10.000.  the loss of our army is very near 20.000 and no fight .  all we done was to charge on the enemy rifle pits and redoubts.  they peppering us with grape and Cannister which mowed our men down like Sheep.  our troops march up to the works in Splendid order.  but just as they got to a certain point. the enemy opened on them which made fearfull havoc amongst them our brigade was ordered to charge up the hill on the right of the road.  well we tried it and got on the. but the enemy were too Strong for us.  they give us grape and rifle balls which Sents us back off the hill. in thrible quick time.  our regt has been very lucky.  we were on the left of the brigade and their fire was mostly on the right of the brigade.  the loss of our brigade was about 500. out of 15.00. our division Gen may be a very good minister but no Gen.  it was worse than Sending the troops into a Slaughter house.  to be butchered.  I do not think that any of our Generals from Bunside down to lowest Showed very good General Ship.  we have found out the loss of our gallant leader Geo B. McClellan.  I hope the goverment has learned a lesson by this last blunder the right grand division has all their courage and pluck taken right out of them. and will never make any more fights like it has. done. all the Generals done was to Sit on their hasses about a mile from the the feild and ordere the men to Charge up the hill.  the irish brigade once drove the enemy from behind there pits.  but could hold it they were murdered.  if the whole army of the united States had been here we could not drove the enemy from his position he was so well fortified.  I wish I was out of the army.  you Say you wish that battle that you hear So much about was over well you have had your wish and how do you like it.  during the five days we were in that infernal place. I had not five hours Sleep or rest. was on picket three nights without fires. what do you think of that for a white man to Stand.  I tell you I was completly played out.  I never breathed so free in my life as I did the night we evacuated the town and planted my feet on this Side of the river.  I think this last blunder will bring on european intervention and this war will be over before a great while.  I for one dont Care how it is now Settled.  my patriotism is knocked out of me.  So you Say you would like me to be adjutant. as they ride a horse and get Shot down easier and quicker.  well: well em I did not think you wanted to get rid of me. in that Style.  So you think it is a pity that miss anderson did not live to plead her own Cause.  I think the reverse.  if She did live. her life would be one of Shame and misery.  but as you Say.  So Say.  I that nothing is too bad for that Scoundrell Simms.  I did not think he would take it So cool</br>
</br>
well Em you will have to whistle for a christmas box or a New Years gift from me before new years.  as we have not Seen the paymaster for nearly Six months. without I can get home and give you myself of which the chances are slim before that time.  I Still keep in very good health considering the circumstances.  I am quiet pleased to hear of you getting So Smart that you Can live on your wits.  keep at it Em and it wont take So much to s Support you Some of these fine days.  my kind regards to all the folks. and accept my best love and wishes.  for I assure you they are Sincere.  I remain yours</br>

</br>
Your ever welcome letter arrived this morning.  I wrote you one from Fredericksburg on the 12th but I guess you have not received it.  for you do not mentioned it in your last.  I Should like to See your Brother very much but as I was on picket pretty much all the time we were over the river that I had no chance to look for him.  it aint the cold Steal and iron that we handle that we dont like it is the hills that your brother speaks off. I wish to God they had drove me to New York while they were at it.  I am getting tired of this war.  it Seems to be full of blunders.  I wish they would let us have McClellan back and give him his own way.  this farce would then be played out in a very Short time.  So you think the men thats left after this war is over.  will not be fit for anything.  well Em I think your are more than half right.  I am very Sorry to hear that your face is Swelled.  I wish you would Send me a Carte de Visile while it is in that condition.  then I Could Set in my tent and pity you.  but why do you not have the tooth pulled.  I Should thing you have Suffered enough with your face I would advise you to get rid of it as Soon as possible. or this Cold weather will keep you fat all winter.  which will keep you from Cutting figures on the ice for I See the ball is up on the park.  I am very thankfull for your kind inlentions to make me a present but under the Circumstance I did not expect one.  but as you Say; better times Coming and that before many days.  when I Shall be able to make you the present.  I am very glad that you did not Send me out any thing by Sergt Maguire.  he has not arrived here yet.  he is in Washington.  So you think I can Come home. now do you well if I Could I would. your are not half as anxious for me to get there as I am but dont you let that idea run away with you about no more fighting this winter it has not began yet.  but it will not be in this direction.  it will be on the peninsula again.  there is a Camp rumor that our Corps will be releived and Sent to the fortifications aroung washington on the account of its reduced numbers.  I hope it is So.  then I Shall get a chance to go home.  please give my Compliments to George. and my respects to all the folks I still enjoy good health.  hoping this will find you So. I will now close with much love</br>

My dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your long looked for letter arrived at last.  I had began to fear that you had forgot all about your Soldier boy.  I wrote a letter last night to you. in which I gave you jessie for not being more prompt in your answer. but I am very glad that I did not mail it. as your letter Came this morning.  well.  you Seem to have enjoyed your New Years.  as you have Said nothing to Contrary.  I Should like to know what them toasts was. and who was the proposers.  So as I Could have the pleasure of responding to them.  but Still I am afraid I could not do them justice for I have only water to drink them in. instead of wine or whiskey.  which is as Scarce as love in this part of our glorious Union.  I am happy to hear that the men enjoyed themselves So well on that day.  I envy those lucky fellows.  who had Such a nice time amongst the gals and wine.  and I think if I had been there I Should have been in there Conditions before night I would have been So as it was if there had been any thing to drink out here.  for I had the blues all day and nothing to do to occupy my mind.  So I just thought all day long of what a fine time all my friends were having.  and of what a high old time I would have if I was there.  I was not mad at my Self or the army Oh No â€“ I am mighty glad your face has gotten well.  you now Can Send me your Carte de visite . and it will look like your Selfe dont forget it.  for I am dying to See you if you will Send it you will do me a great favour.  I Shall in return if you wish it.  get one takeing and Send it to you at the first oppertunity.  I am axnious for to See the end of this war as you are but I do not think I will Serve three years in this army.  I think I Shall resign the first oppertunity that is offered in fact I am getting tired of the way they work every thing at the War department</br>
</br>
I have no news of any kind that would be interesting to you.  every thing is very quiet here.  I am quiet pleased with those lines you Send me.  I Shall treasure up that jewell of a heart.  and it is my dearest boast.  but Still the one that is given in return must be Cherished also.</br>
</br>
I Still enjoy my usual health hoping this will find enjoying the great blessing I will now conclude with my best wishes and affectionate love</br>

My dear Em</br>
</br>
Your ever welcome letter of the 14inst arrived here this morning.  So you See I answer it immediatly.  if I was there and you was away I would be just as punctual in my letters as I am at the present time I did not think of my letter arriving So near New Years day or I would not Said any thing about it. for I know young ladies have so much to attend to a week before and a week after new years that they Cannot find time to write to those absent</br>
</br>
You ought to have filled up your whole letter about my Saying I would get drunk if I had been there on the first. dont you think it would be natural for a person to do So. after being away from home for 19 months but Still Em.  I have keep my promise.  I have never been under the influence of liquor there is not a man in this whole army who Can Say they have Seen me So.  but I think i would have been So on that day.  I dont want to go as far as home to get drunk. for they have at times enough to make the whole army So.</br>
</br>
that Carte do visite  I Should very much like to get but I will not ask for it again you Say you will Send one the first oppertunity why there is not a day but what you pass a half a dozen places where they take them as for mine I Shall Send as Soon as I have the oppertunity but it will be Some time yet as</br>
</br>
Burnside has just Sent an order Stating that we are about moving on the enemy and that we move to morrow morning at day light.  So you may expect to hear of bloody victory or the destruction of the whole army of the potomac.  for burnside will not recross the river like he did at the last Fredericksburg affair</br>
</br>
I Should like to make the accuatiences of that Ghost as they Call it.  he Seems to be a friendly ghost. and is Causing great deal of excitement up town.  I have read Some thing about it.  I hardly think I will dream of it.  for I have Some thing else on my mind at present.  I expect to See Some thing more terrible than ghost</br>
</br>

My dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your pleasant and ever welcome letter arrived this morning.  it afforded me much more pleasure than your last your last was nothing but a Censure on my Conduct.  which I think was not needed espeicialy from you. for you ought to be the last person to upraid me for Such.  it rather Cut me to See you write the way you did.  for I have always held my character far above Suspicion or reprimand.  for I have never be reprimanded Since being in the army you was the first one to do So.  when I thought you would be the last which made me cross and out of spirit when I wrote my last if I had done what you had hinted.  I Should never have got along as well as I have done or hold the position I do.</br>
</br>
I did not think it would be three years or over three months when I first Came out at this war.  I remember telling you when I came away that three years would be a long time to wait but I did not think I would be away half of that time or I would never have enlisted.  I have often been Sorry that I asked you to wait untill this war was over.  for it has kept you from enjoying your Self.  where you might have had plenty of enjoyment.  I know you think it is a good while to look ahead.  not only a year. but untill this unhappy war is brought to an end.  I am keeping you from enjoying the best part of your life.  but I dont wish to.  I would rather you would go in Company more than you do.  for should I get maimed or killed towards the close of my enlistment there would be three years of the best part of your life thrown away and it would be very difficult for you to again pick them up.  but you must not go to work and take a wrong meaning out of this letter for it is for you I think and not formyself.  I assure you my love and affection for you are Stronger than ever.  I only think that if any thing should happen to me. that you would be in any thing but a pleasant Situation.  I can assure I am looking forward to the day when we Can always be with each other but I write the above in Case of accident to my self.  for I can not run through this war without Something to happen.  I have been exceedingly fortunate. but it Cannot last always but I pray to god it So. and that this war to Speedily end.  and me Safely home when I Shall fullfill all my promises to you but I must Stop this or you will think I getting lonely or melancholy</br>
</br>
Those two drinks you mentioned in your letter was very good.  only there was not enough of them.  I know where you found out about them two drinks they told me.  my Emma (as they Called you) was there and Sent her Sent her repect to me.  I told them that if they Should again See Miss Knight to give her my best respects. and that I Should be most So happy to accompany her to the Shainghi ball.  if possible.  was that right</br>
</br>
I am Sorry that I Could not get your Carte de visite. but under the Circumstances I Shall not expect it.  but thank you all the Same as if I had it.  I Shall most assuredly tell George about the likeness he sent home.  as you know your self that what ever you write to me is not for other peoples eyes or ears</br>
</br>
If you must go to the the Shanghi ball and to 23 home Carriage you Can. but dont engage your self to Soon. for I may get home for the Shanghid and claim you. but as for 23 ball you Can do as you please.  but if I am home you need not expect me to take you there. I hardly think I would go to it myself if I was home. as to the Shanghis I Shall be there if I Can.</br>
</br>
Johny Maguire is a deserter. and I dont whan want to hear any thing about him or from him.</br>
</br>
I am really Sorry for the young lady that fainted it must be a Sad Sight. to See a young lady in that Siutation I never Seen you faint Em but you Came near it once. at the Newark bay grove.  I never Shall forget it. especially when I See ropes hanging from trees. excuse for the mentioned the above</br>
</br>
We have just been paid off but only for four (4) months leaving the goverment into our debt for over three months now.  I take the liberty to enclose twenty (20) dollars and ask you to accept it as a present from me. not having a chance at New Years to do so</br>
</br>
The army of the potomac is played out if I may So use the vulgar expression, Gens Burnside, Sumners and Franklin have left us and joe Hooker is now in Command what he will do remains to be Seen, he is an excellant fighting Gen with a Small Corps or division but his quality for handling large bodyes of troops are not much thought of.  the army has not much confidence in him as a leader.</br>
</br>
I am enjoying the best of health hoping this will find you the Same.  My respect to George and the rest of the family</br>
</br>
Adieu my dear Em.  accept my most affectionate love and ever believe that I am yours</br>
</br>
Edward Charles Cauvet</br>

Fondly love my heart is beating</br>

With affection true to thee</br>

My dear Emma</br>
</br>
having just arrived in Camp. I sit down without resting to let you know that I arrived Safe and well. after a hard and tiresome journey which was very fatiguing to me.  my reception in Camp was very different from what I expected.  instead of having to report to the provost marshall. as I thought.  I was received by the officers with a warm and welcome Shake of the hands and by the men of the whole regiment with a Salute of the hard and a happy Smile on their faces.  which Showed how I was liked in the regiment.  but for all the reception I received.  I did not forget you. for one moment.  Oh how I Should like to be with you this evening for I know you will miss me very much. as I do you. but never  mind my dear Em but keep up a Stout heart and look forward to the time when I Shall again Come back to you for ever.  and that will be before (as the Song Says) this cruel war is over.  I asked the Major if he will approve of my resignation. but he Says no not as long as he is in the regiment but when he thinks he is going to leave. he will then approve of it.  So you See he wants to keep me</br>
</br>
My friends meet me at the nothern hotel according to appointment.  we had a jolly good time.  and I guess that Some of them went home in a very good humor especially the Barber who was as happy as a lord and thought I had the biggest of any man in the Country.  to leave my friends in Such good humor.  but he did not See my heart.  nor did he See me the night before when I was with you.  or he would not Say So the traveling in the Cars was very tedious especially through philadelphia and baltimore. where we had to Change Cars and go through with horses which took exactly one hour for each place.  arriving in Washington at Â½ past 7 O clock.  too late for acquia creek boat.  so I put up at the St. Charles hotel where I Slept pretty much all day went to minstrells at Canterbury Hall at night which place they do not allow ladys and gentleman Smoke and drink all through the performance. but there is no girls. waiters. and plays was Select and at first I was surprised to see men Smoking in the place.  well that had an end like everything else at 11 O clock went to hotel and had a good Sleep. woke up this morning in time catch the boat arrived at acqui at 12 O clock.  took Cars at 3 O clock arrived here a few minuets ago.  having to Carry my Valise over 3 mile through a deep muck which made me quiet tired and made me perspire nearly as much as I did at the assembly rooms last Thursday night.  I reached camp just in time to Save a good ducking for it is raining as hard as it Can pour.  So you See I Still have my good luck with me but dear Em I must stop.  for if I go on at this rate I will have to get another peice of paper and I know it would be a bore to you to read So much from me.  So I Shall Conclude by Sending my best respects to all your family. and our friends. and accept my most warm and affectionate love all too your Self.  hoping for a speedy answer</br>
</br>
I remain truly and</br>

</br>
It is just one week since I have been in Camp and eleven days Since I have Seen you.  I have been looking very anxiously for a letter from you but none has yet arrived and Seems to be a very long time Since I left you.  being alone this afternoon. I thought I could not occupy my time in a more pleasing way than by writing to you.  this place has got to be so Confounded dull Since I was here before I almost pray for a move to take away the monotony of Camp life.  in one Sence of the word we have Change enough that is we have picket duty enough to do.  out once every three days.  where we have to Stand on the bank of the river for Six hours without fires and what makes it Seem Still harder is that the enemy opposite has large fires all day and night and laugh at us fellows without any.  this morning we were Called out of our warm beds at 3 O clock to be under arms until day light.  it was reported the enemy had Crossed and were marching down the Hartford road which leads to our Camp.  but nothing more has been heard from it Since and the men thinks it  was an april fool</br>
</br>
The weather here is awful one day clear the next day Storm.  I am getting sick and tired of it and wish I was back Safe and to you.  but how to get back is the question I have to Study.  I hardly think of any thing else but getting out of the Service.  I talk So much of it. that the officers thing my visit to New York  has Spoiled me or they Say Some girl has got a hold of me.  for I was not anxious to leave before going.  they did not know how near they were right when they Sayest So. there Seems to be only one way for me to get out and that is to be dismissed.  but june is a long time yet and Some thing may turn up in my favor.  my Stars is Still lucky.  I would rather help Louisa to take the Clothes of the line than be here My love to all the folks and dont you be afraid to write.  the oftener the letter I Shall always remember them with pleasure so accept my most affectionat love I remain yours only Edwd C. Cauvet</br>
</br>
Excuse the envelope as I have no large ones fit to Send.  I have sent for Some So I be all right in my next dont forget and immediatly and often and you will really oblige</br>

You can not imagine with what pleasure and joy I received you anxiously look for letter.  It came to me last evening about nine O clock.  I had Company in my tent at the time but I Could not wait until they went away.  but had to open it and read immediatly.  when one of the officers Said that there must be Some thing good in that letter.  I asked him why.  he Says that he See my eyes brighten.  and that I looked pleasant and was in better humor.  I told him that it was a letter from a near and a dear friend and that it was the first letter that I received since leaving New York.  I also received three others with it one from Ed Towner and the other two from Brother and Sister</br>
</br>
My dear Em.  I know how bad you felt the day I left. and was very glad that you kept in as you did or I would as you Say never have left you and I would now be a deserter and a Subject to the draft.  after I left you that day I went home and found Mrs Woods at the house.  you promised to go with her and mrs Graham to Lords.  She asked Me if I had See you that day.  I Said I had just left you.  Mrs Wood Said that you would not go any where that day.  Mrs. Towner Said poor Emma.  She must feel very bad, I was in good Spirits from all appearances but they Could not See my feeling.  not even when the whole house was in tears but after I had left my friends then I began to realize what and whom I left and began to feel it.  it is not only Suday or Wenesday evenings that I think of you but all times.  on duty and off of duty and especially when up all night on picket I keep following that Star.  that you made a wish on.  I am all time wishing on that Star and for you too.  it is my guiding Star.  you must go out.  dont stay in the house on my account. no I would rather See you enjoying your Self I did expect a description of our album but dont hurry your Self.  but get a nice one if you have not enough to get it wait a week or two.  when I Shall let you have what  promised with the addition I wish I had the oppertunity of going with you to buy it with you  you would half as much like it as me. as to going back to the Tract house.  I would not do it  unless I would better myself do you think the girls are near right in what they Say about you.  I do and hope that every word will Come out true dont you and if it dont it will not be my fault.  the draft is going to take place Soon and the Conscript will fill up all the old regiments.  we have the order there is to to muster on the 10th of april to See how many Conscripts each regt will want.  the weather here is very uncertain yesterday very cold and windy.  last night a heavy fall of Snow to day cloudy and blustery.  this is Sunday Oh how I should like to be Some where to night.  would you not like to See Some body to night.  Em hey I wrote you a letter last wenesday.  I could not wait for an answer to mine.  I wanted to Converse with you.  So I wrote it and expect a prompt answer from it and all my letters.  no one letter for two any more.  that wont do.  there is no news here and no Signs of the army untill after the draft takes place no for two months after it.  remember me to all your folks. I just feel like giving Louisa a few lessons my health is good and hope yours is the same.  will the renewal of my warmest and most affectionate love I remain only yours</br>

</br>
I received your ever welcome letter last evening. just as was about returning for the night.  you Can not imagine how Sweetly I slept after reading it.  I am Sorry you were So disapointed in receiving my letter. that you did not be the first one to get one.  but my dear Em you Can not blame me for it.  I assure you that I wrote to you first and immedatly after reaching Camp. but it was not in time for the mail that night.  the next day I wrote sixteen letters to my friends.  which I Suppose all went in the Same mail with yours. if you think you dont get your letters Soon enough I will direct them to your place of business if you wish it. but I hardly think you would.</br>
</br>
I am glad to hear that they have to knuckle under at the Tract house. if you go back.  I wish you would be a little dignified and Stiff with them and dont take any impudence or freedom with that forman.  feel as if you were independent of him. and I hope before long that you will be So and your journeys down town at an end</br>
</br>
You Say you wish I was more tired of the army than I am.  I must confess that I am not tired of it nor do I think I ever would be if it was not for you.  it is for you only that I am tired and want to leave this Service and Shall do it the first oppertunity.  So you See that you are worth Some thing to me.  for to make me give it up</br>
</br>
I expect a minute description of the album when you get it. but dont hurry your Self and get one that you like</br>
</br>
I am extremely obliged to you for your wishes to do Some thing for me.  but dear Em I want So little that I generaly get Henry or Ed Towner ??? and them.  such as envelopes or Stamps.  there is one thing Something I want which they can not Send and you are the only Can do it.  but I Suppose I shall have to go after it myself.  and that Something is your Self</br>
</br>
We have beautifull weather lately.  Such as generaly gives a person the spring fever or in other words makes him so lazy that he can hardly move.  put me in mind of ice cream time.  I hope we have many a plate together this summer</br>
</br>
I have cut a paragraph out of a paper which is Signed old Bach.  I want to know if it So. and if it is. I wonder how Such a man found it out I think old Bach is a married man put dase not own up to it</br>
</br>
My health is better than ever which looks bad for me getting a doctor certificate to resign on.  but I will have to trust to luck.  I am going to get out and I will or my name will not be Edd.  there is an order to Consolidate the regiments of ??? 500. men into five Comps which will ??? means of mustering out the Colonel. Major and the Surplus Captains & Lieuts leaving only five of each my times is then or never remember me to all the folks  I will now conclude with my most affectionate.

My dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your most welcome letter arrived this evening.  So you had no idea that the fight was to Come off So Soon. or you would have wrote me a different kind of a letter.  I Should like to know in what way you would write it.  it pleased me as it was.  well Em this fight is over and we have been badly whipped So much for joe Hooker it has turned out just the way I Said it would when I was in New York.  but we are agoing to have another one in a few days.  the reason I Say So is that we are under Marching orders and that joe Hooker is desperate over his defeat and wants to do Some thing to gain favour.  but just So Sure as he crosses that river.  just so Sure he will get whipped.  if the north and administration wants to Settle this war. why they had better let us have the boss (G.B. McC.) he is the only one that Can do it all our Major Gen has killed their twenty thousand.  but Fremont and if they give him Command he will kill his forty thousand.  and if Hooker keeps Command he will do the Same.  the first army corps went by Camp yesterday.  they were not engaged on the right.  So George is all right I See him last Saturday.  he was well.  but I think I told you of it in my last letter.  I was So tired when I wrote it that I dont know what I put in it.  My ideas were all Confused and dreamy.  which I know you will excuse me for its Shortness.  I wrote it at that time because I thought you would be very anxious to hear from Me.  Nothwithstanding I Said I would not be brought in to the engagement.  Nor did I think So when I wrote I will never give false hopes.  I dont think the army of the potomac Can be engaged with out having our brigade (the iron brigade it is now Called) in the fight.  but Sunday morning at 1. O clock we left our palace Garden Camp. arriving behind the Lacy house at day light.  where we Soon crossed over our potoon into Fredericksburg where we formed line of battle in princes Ann Street. waiting until 9 O clock when our brigade were ordered to Charge those terrible works on the right of the town while Sedgwick with the Sixth Corps charged the left.  it was the death knell of many.  and plenty of poor fellows bite the dust.  they had a raking fire on us.  but our brigade escaped with a Comparatively Small loss.  we Carried the works at noon.  Completly routing them through their 2nd and third works.  when our division was ordered back to do provost duty in the town while Sedgwick followed them up we thought we were agoing to have a nice time of it.  and went to work picking out houses for quarter and making our selves Snug.  which we did next morning at daylight our pickets reported the enemy Coming.  we laughed at it and could not believe it.  but as Soon as the fog cleared up their Sure enough we See the rebels filling in around their fortifications and rifle pits we were astonished and wondered how they got in rear of Sedwick we threw our whole force (which was very Small) out  on the picket line and waited for an attack.  but did not have to wait long they immediattly advanced their Skirmishers.  we waiting until they were within a 100 yds.  when we opened a tremendous volley from right to left which Made them think we had a very Strong force. and they Skedaddle back to their work in double quick time.  if they had kept advancing they would either killed every man of us or took us prisoners.  we were determined to hold our own at all risks.  which we did untill tuesday Morning when orders Came to evacuate the town.  which we did in good order.  Marching Company front through the Streets.  it would made some of our militia regts at home blush to See us.  have Such a fine Column with the enemy at our heels.  the 42nd had the honor to be the last leaving the town arriving on this side we found that the whole army had Crossed back to this Side of the river and that Sedgwick foughts his way to Banks ford and crossed Safe after fighting very hard and losing a great Many Men.  and here we are at Falmouth once More, been over the river and had a big fight last thousand of men and cannon a few also made a grand Skedaddle back again and Nothing gained but every thing lost but Still I had the Satisfaction and pleasure of assisting in drawing them out of their Stronghold behind Fredericksburg and taking a good look at the works.  which are beautifull and in a Splendid position and I dont want to Charge them again.  the thoughts of it. even Makes Me Sick its terrible to think after once gaing them and then give them up with out a Struggle to have to go at it again when they will have more works built.  they are already throwing them up.  the visions of easy times and provost duty in the beautifull town of Fredericksburg are gone.  fizzled.  played out.  well up I keep on war tactic any longer t you will think I have war on the brain.  I could run on all day long in this Strain.  I dont Say much about the doings on the right.  for we Cannot find out how bad the defeat was.  there is all Sorts of rumors about it.  they will not even allow the news papers to Come.  So we know only what we See</br>
</br>
So you had a laugh did you I knew blame well that you either had been or was going to Bryants. and I dont blame you.  go it while your young for when you get old you Cant.  but dont beat around the bush to find out what I think or Say but Come right out Say you are going.  I dont want you to Stay away from amusements on my account.  for My Chances are ten to one that I will get the roof of my head knocked off.  that is if I Stay in the Service.  if that Should happen why you would lose the best part of your life and all for a deceitfull young man.  I know you like to go to those places well enough and I think you ought to go every change you get.  that is with propriaty.  you Say I will not believe what you put in the letter.  how Can I when you have found you out so often.  that Song, I am lonely to night would just Suit me out here.  for I am out of spirits Since our defeat.  I hardly think there would be much Sowing done if I was in New York.  but I guess you do but little in that line at the best of times.  I heartily join you in your wish that I was back for good.  I would run all risks of the draft.  it would be more easy to clear that.  than to get clear of where I am.  So you were thinking of me all the time.  well why shouldnt you.  I even think of you in the din of battle when balls is as thick as flys in the Summer.  I assure it is a fact.  it Surprises Myself.  that I think of one So far away. when every Second may be my last.  but Em. what is to be will be.  my old motto, the boys, Say I am not born to be shot.  I feel proud to think. that you at last give in that your are interested in me.  but did you worry much while at Bryants.  Ha. Ha.  well my dear Em I will Stop.  I am well and out Safe this time and hope to be the next and with your prayers. I will assuredly Come out Safe.  you are my guardian angel.  I am very glad that your Cold is better.  I have had two good nights rest and again feel myself a Cauvet remember me to all your folks and inquiring friends.  and accept your self my most warm and fond love.  I Shall ever remain most faithfully yours only</br>

Your interesting and ever welcome letter dated May 10th was received by me this after Noon.  So the papers give encouraging accounts of the late battles.  well the papers dont know any thing about it if he Hooker gained any thing by that last Series of battles.  why did. he recross the river.  of if he has cut off all their Supplies and railroad Communication. why Not attack the enemy at once.  Now is the time to do it.  and not wait untill they repair their telegraphs.  railroads.  and build redoubts forticfications and rifle pits.  which they are doing with great vigor.  but no he will wait untill they get every spot that was weak Strenthed.  then I suppose he will Make another attack which undoubtly unsuccesfull because. he Hooker has Not got the head to handle So large army.  there is no doubt of his being a good fighter.  when he has 25.000 men and under orders of a superior office but to Command 100.000 men. he has not the ability.  the country dont seemed to be large enough for him. in his evidence before the war Comitee. he Said our defeats on the peninsula was inefficiency of the Commanding Gen. little did he think that those very words. would apply to himself So Soon Why Sedgwicks and Stoneman done all the fighting that was any way Successfull if it had Not been for our Cavalry raid the defeat of Hooker would have been the most disastrous of the war. but Stonemans Success give the North great Spirits where it would have been nothing but gloom I fervently and Sincerly hope that this army of the potomac. will at Some future day have a Commanding Gen that will lead it on and give it Victory.  it has been so far been very unfortunate.  and I am getting heartily Sick of. So Many reverses and feel as if I would like us to again Cross this river. take up the bridges behind us.  So that we would have to fight. we would then be victorious.  for I know we Can whip those fellows.  I am tired of this prolonged war.  we Can not See when or where it will end by fighting and falling back every two months with a loss from 10.000 to 30.000 lives each time.  the longer I am here the More. disgusted I am with the way the war is managed.  if I was only clear I guarantee I would never Come in it again.  if Success would follow our aims I would willingly Stay untill the war was over.  but the imbecility of this goverment will never end it.  there is a great deal of what is Called treason in this letter which if found by any person. would disgrace me from the army for ever. and give me a home in fort Lafayette.  but I Cannot help.  I must speak out.  but their is no Copperheadism in Me.  Oh no. any thing but that. your Brother George. Spent the afternoon with me last tuesday.  he is well and told me to mention him in my letter when I wrote home.  what do you think of that word home.  he also wanted to know when I heard from home.  I thought it was pretty good the way he Spoke the word home.  Maguire was in the tent with me at the time I dont know what he thought home meant his Georges Corps was not engaged on the right.  they were acting as reserve.  I went riding yesterday with the intention of going to See him but a thunder Storm Came up and I I only went as far as the 3rd Corps.  I Shall ride over Sunday and See him if the lord spares me and weather permitting. So you think you was honored by an introduction to a Gen.  well I dont know about that. a Gen is not more than any other man. and I begin to think they are not as good.  So you think if I was in New York. that I would be Carting you to the part on Suday afternoons well I hardly think I Should. yes My dear Em june is coming and there dont seems to be the least possible Chance of my getting out of the Service.  well if I dont Come home it will not be my fault.  for god knows I want to bad enough.  I have glory enough in this war. and do not want to be a hero any longer My patriotism is oozing out very fast I have been through to many hardships and gained Nothing by it.  I am also losing the best part of my life and another year of such life will Make Me feel 10 years older than I really am.  So the young men are going to die before they will be drafted well it is not very nice to have the name of a Conscript but Still it will be useless to resist the draft. for once the goverment attemps it. they will take a man dead or alive.  that just So. you will lose a whole day to turn out when I Come will you if you do not lose more.  I will give you leave to Call me Names.  but if we do not get recruits or Conscripts there will be none of the bold Tammay to come home.  our duty men at present is 133 one year More will Carry them away.  it Consoling aint it.  to think how many arrests loses in 12 month.  a nine months regt.  127 Perm of our brigade went home to day.  it numbered 700 men.  it leaves the brigade 550 Strong. a heavy brigade aint it.  I tell I felt like going home My Self when I See those fellows Marching away.  they have done very little Service always broke in an engagement. the Move of Hookers Seems to be on a Stand Still.  we here nothing more of it.  I think he is afraid to move.  George is a great Hooker Man what he sees in him I cannot Say.  he told me they would not allow them to Send letters of he would have wrote home.  I guess I had better Stop or you will think I am getting out of Mind. to bore you with such long and nonsensical letters.

Your ever welcome letter dated. May 12th I received yesterday I would have answered it last evening if I had Not Made an engagement to go riding to day.  knowing that I would See your Brother George. in my ride. and that you and your folks would like to hear from him.  it was a beatuifull day and riding was Mighty pleasant.  we found Georges Camp about five Miles from here.  Situated in a very nice woods of small trees. we happened just in time for dinner of which we partook quit freely as it was a long ride and we were a little bit hungry.  we also Spent a Couple hours very agreeable to gether.  but I assure you I would rather Spend that much time in his Sister Company.  he Says he will write a long letter home to morrow I told him about Mother worrying about him.  you need not have any fears of my being Sick.  on account of low Spirits if you Could See Me. laughing and joking you would not think any Such thing.  but once in a while I get those angry Spells over. and I let myself loose.  I suppose I Must have been in one of those when I wrote that letter well. I Cannot help when talking about the army and its Commanders.  its enough to Set a fellow crazy.  the way every thing is blundered.  you Say that you dont think that I would get another girl as true to Me as you are.  I dont know as I Should.  for if you was Not true to Me.  I Should never give another girl a change to be true or untrue.  I never would trust one with even a look.  I would then Swear all the Female Sex was false.  I would then Stay in the army. and be an old Bachelor.  why I have been just as true to you as you have been to Me.  and it is very few Men that will be Satisfied with having one girl.  but I assure you that Since I Commenced going to See you. that I have been faithfull and true to My every promise.  and intend to So always as long you think prudent.  I do not Mistrust you far from it.  I never had Occasion to do nor do I think I Shall.  all I Said in My letters to that effect was only jokieing. but if it hurts your feelings. I hope to be excused and I Shall be More guarded in future of what I write.  if you dont look out I will be home before that Skirt is finished I heard to day that the Consolidation of regts go in effect next week. and the Tamany will be put in two Companys.  but I am afraid the news is too good to be true.  Oh if it is only So you will See Edd in the promised time when he will Claim all promises.  I dont think the will Move inside of two months without Lee crosses the river and drives us back to Washington.  of which I have no fear.  the only thing I am Mad at is that Hooker did not Mov on the enemy where we had him Crippled.  but I guess I had better Stop war talk. or I will get agoing and wont know when to Stop.  the weather is dreadfull warm.  but we have nothing of any Consequence to do.  So I guess we can Stand it.  I am excedingly gratefull for all your kind wishes for My welfare and Safety.  remember Me to all your folks.  and accept my warm true and Sincere love.  I remain as ever</br>

I think I like the color Much better than if it was green.  you know I am Not like most irishmen I Cant Say as I like this favorite color of the emerald isle.  So you did Not think I had any good times out here.  you are Mighty Mistakeing in your idea of the army.  if it was Not for you I think I would like this life and think it was one of the happiest and gayest business.  I have yet had any thing to do with.  I wish you was here. and Could accompany Me in My evening rides. from just before Sun down untill dark.  I know you would like it.

I would not Care if the corners were bit off Well dear Em I dont know what to write about.  every thing is just the Same here as Since I last wrote to you.  the weather has been Cloudy but no rain as yet. but we are praying for it as every thing is very dry. but before that the weather was intensely warm  My health is very good.  I am getting very fat again and begin to look like one of those dutch pork butchers around New york.  well I guess there is about nonsence enough in this letter but I know you will excuse it So I Shall con clude by hopeing this will find your Mother much better.  if not quiet well remember Me kindly to Lousia and all the rest.  hopeing your are well.  accept My Most warm love and kindest respects and wishes.

It is just one week Since I wrote to you and over that Since I received your.  thinking Some thing Must be the Mather.  either you was Sick or that my letters or yours has Miscarried and I embrace this oppertunity to write to you for I May Not have another Chance for Some time again for there is every indications of a Movement,  there was Some of our troops Crossed the river yesterday afternoon.  one Mile from here just below Fredericksburg.  and are Still over there.  last evening and this Morning,  there was very heavy firing of artillery but very little Musketry.  our Corps (2) is under Marching orders with three days rations.  and we expect to Cross to Morrow.</br>
</br>
I Must tell you of a little incident that happend on our picket front last Sunday while Maguire was on duty,  it Concerns us both and I would Not have it happen for a great deal expecially at the time it did.  two officers Came riding along the picket line very drunk when they asked Maguire what regt he belonged to he told them when they cried out jesus Christ the Tammany why we know every damn officer in the regt and we Come from the 95 New York they began to be very free with johny.  Swearing very loud and profusely and talking very fast.  when Maguire expostulated with them but it was but it no use.  they would not keep quiet.  they Said that they were from New York and that johny Could not play them for flats.  why Say one of them (the Captain), Captain Cauvet of your regt is my Second Lieuts brother in law Maguire asked him Lieuts Name he Say George Knight.  I would not Cared a Straw about if they had only been sober and some other officer on duty except johny.  for it was just what he wanted to get hold off he has Suspected that I was married while home.  and he Say that I Cannot keep it a Secret any longer.  that I have kept it Still a good long time but it is out at last I tryed to Make him believe different but he dont See it and I Suppose he herald it to all our accuantances and friend before this.  as he thinks it is too good to be kept to himself.  he say he has Seen my brother in law.  the officers here all believe it is So.  and will not believe to the Contrary.  they Say that George would not told officers if it was Not I Cannot think what made him do it.  the officers behaved like any thing else but as Soldiers and gentlemen.  they even went So far as insult a Couple of Ladys that live in the Village it was very lucky for them that it was not me that was on duty at the time.  I Should have placed them both under arrest and Confined them in the provost guard.  I gave johny a good talking too for Not doing it.  he Said he did not like to on account of them knowing George and Myself.  it has placed us both in a delicate Situation for every body will think it so.  but Still it Cannot Now be helped and its no use of crying over spilt Milk I Tell you all this in Confidence I dont want you to Say a word about it to either George or your folks as it will only make Matters worse.  May be Some of your folks has give George to understand that we are Married.  for I believe some of them thinks So.  I am Sorry is has happened.  as it will give gossipers Some thing to talk about May be Maguire will Not Say any thing about. but he is a great deal like a woman Cannot keep any thing to him self.  Now My dear Em Not a word of this to any one and you will Confer a great favour on Me</br>
</br>
My health is very good So is My Spirits hoping this will find you enjoying the Same great blessing. accept my Most warm love and best wishes. respects &c. &c. I remain </br>

</br>
I received your always welcomed this evening. with Much pleasure.  I did Not expect it quiet So early. the Mail must have gone right through and you Must have answered it immediatly.  for it is only Seven days to the very hour Since I wrote to you.  the letter of which your was an answer too</br>
</br>
The ring has Not arrived yet and what is worse it never will.  Some body has felt it in the letter and took it.  I wish you had gotten Spunky and refused to Send it too me.  as you Say you had a Mind to for it would have been far better in your keeping than where it is. well who ever has got it.  I wish him good luck with it.</br>
</br>
There Now you Need Not get in a huff when I say that a woman Can never keep a Secret.  and you know it is So.  with the majority of them of Course there is a few exceptions and I think you are one of them but as far as you not knowing a man that Can keep a Secret you dont mean what you Say.  not half of it.</br>
</br>
You Say you would like to tell Mother of what was in my letter.  So you Could find out what whether She ever Said any thing to George.  I do not think She Said any thing to that effect.  but I think Sarah May have done it as She writes to him Some time.  I dont think that the Showing of the picture had any thing to do with it.  I would rather you would have nothing to Say about it too your folks.  for it might make trouble for you.  you Might ask you Mother in a jokeing kind of a way.  and if She wanted to know why you asked you Can tell her that George hinted as Much to me or you Can Make any excuse you deem proper only Say Nothing of whats in the letter.  it is all past and let it drop.  I am Sorry Now that I ever Said any thing about it to you and you would Never No any thing about it.  but I like a big fool have to tell you every thing.  Some how I Can Not rest easy untill I inform you.  especially when it Concerns you</br>
</br>
What fell away nine (9) pounds in Six weeks.  why Em you Must have been Sick or else the Scales was not right.  if neither has been the Case you Must have worried very Much to have Made you fall away that much.  this weather tends to take Some flesh off of fleshy persons.  I hardly think that worrying for Me done it hey Em.  if it is So.  I would advise you to take the world as it goes and Never worry untill the worst Comes home to you.  if I Should not get in another engagement.  why not come out with my usual good luck.  Some body has to Come out and why Not Me.  I have no idea of getting Shot in this war.  the only thing I dread is to be taken prisoner and I never will if I Can help it.  I expect to Come home to you a Safe and Sound.  and a better man both physically and morally and I am looking for that day with great interest So dear Em never worry about me.  but always look an the bright Side and happier days when this cruel war is ended</br>
</br>
It is raing very hard this evening the first we have had Since the 5th of May.  the ground sokes the rain up as fast as it falls it so dry.  I am writing this to night but I am afraid that no mail will go in the morning.  for every thing looks as if we were agoing to Skedaddle from here.  it Seems that Lee is getting too Strong for Hooker.  the reason I think we are going to leave.  is that we were ordered to pack up to night with four days rations also word was brought from the depot that they were takeing away the Cars and had tar buckets under it by day light. to morrow morning I think we will be under way either for Washington or Fredericksburg but I think the former.  My health is very good and spirits in high glee for the move.  I am tired of heading My letters Falmouth and I hope My next will be headed different.  remember Me to all your family hoping this will find you and them enjoying good health. adieu My dear Em accept My best and Most Since love I remain yours and only yours</br>

Stafford court house.  Monday june 15th 1863.  we left Falmouth a little after day light this morning. our brigade bringing up the the rear.  we expected the enemy to attack us but they have not Showed them selves yet.  our march this morning was 12 Miles and we expect to go 12 more this afternoon the weather very Sulty & dusty. we are now in line of battle waiting for the enemy.

Duf Dumfries june 16th arrived here this morning at 7. O clock after marching about 10 miles Since day light.  the march yesterday was the worst I ever had.  warm dusty the men was falling down pretty thick from heat and Some fell dead and all of my little Company four dropped down.  our Gen when they get on horse back dont think how hard it is to march through the warm Sun and dust but I suppose they are in a hurry to get away from the rebs but I think the men would rather wait and fight as to Skedaddle in Such a hurry we leave for fair fax Station at 2. O clock no chance to Send away this letter.  but the first Camp I reach.  I will put in their mail bag.  I remain tired Hungry and dusty your Eddie</br>
</br>
Occaquan River 6 P.M. june 16th Marched 27 miles to day through a dusty road and a hot day I fel feel played out we are to March again at two O clock to night I dont know what we will do.  as we have lost a great many allready by fatigue and heat.  the rumor here is that the rebs are in Maryland and that we have to hurry up to meet them.  no more at present from your Eddie</br>
</br>
Fairfax Station at 2 PM the warmest day yet.  more men fell ill from heat than what Stayed in the rank this beats the Seven days retreat last june.</br>
</br>
Jun 17th as there is a mail leaving this morning I Shall Send this at last.  but there has no mail Come to us.  the morning is very close and Sultry.  I dont know whether we will move or not to day.  Some think. we are going to Harrisburg PA</br>

I received your ever welcome letter yesterday at with the greatest of pleasure that I now answer it.  I wrote you a letter last Saturday evening and finished it on thursday.  I Suppose you have got it by that time.  I have not much news for we dont See the papers any more Since we have been marching but we hear all sorts of reports of where the rebs are.  but from all accounts ther are raising Old Ned up in Pa. and that we will have a chance to join in the Sport as they return down the Valley that is if Hooker is Smart.  I think they will have to give us McClellan back soon for he is the only Man that Can Cope with Lee.  I expect to See Some tall fighting next week or hear of it I am afraid that we (2nd Corps) are too far behind to join the main army it rained very hard last night and looks as if we are going to have Some more to day.  I will write every chance I get so no more at present.  but excuse this note for pen, inks paper and time are very Scares.  accept my Still and most sincere love I remain</br>

having a few moment rest and thought I would drop a few lines to let you know I am well and into the state ,,My Maryland,, two weeks ago to day since we left Falmouth and have been marching every day with the exception of three days at Thoroughfare gap.  we March from 13. to 21. miles a day Camping from at 12 and 1. O clock at night.  moving at day light in the morning I feel very tired every night but in the Morning all right again.  it is the Most Severe and hardest Campaign ever I experienced.  it is not over yet we Move again to day as far as South Mountain.  we have went over 130. miles with but very little rest the weather has been very bad the last week raing most every day.  before that it was very warm it is from one extreme to the other. we (2nd Corps) have not Seen any of the enemy yet only when leaving thoroughfare gap when the Came out with two peices of artillery and a few Cavalry and opened on our division killing and wounding 8 men in the 19 maine 2nd regt 19 maine in our rear.  we just moved far enough to be out of harms way the last mail we had was at fairfax Station June 19th just 10 days ago and I am almost crazy for my letters News Came last night that Hooker was releived and Meade was Commanding the army it Seems to put Spirits in the troops.  they think G. B. McC will be placed at the head of his army of potomac in a few days if the goverment will only do So.  the enthusiasm would be So great that there would not be the Slightest doubt but what the rebs would receive the most Severe whipping of the war. but Still the army likes every body better than Lighting joe as he is Called.  I dont know of any thing else only that we expect another fight in a few days Some where between Antietam and Chambersburg</br>
</br>
To Morrow is the last day of june and I am Still in the army with not the Slightest hopes of getting out without the rebs wipe me out. and I will have to trust to luck on that.  I shall have to bring the to a close accept my most Sincere and purest love hopeing this will reach you in good time and find you in the best of health and spirits as it leaves</br>

Having a few Moments rest I thought I would write a few lines to you to let you know that I am Safe and well.  I received your last letter dated june 28th on july 8th it was the first mail for 19 days there was also one dated on 24th that was the last news I had from home.  I See George the day after I wrote to you he was well.  he told me to mention him when I wrote home.  it is just one month all but two days since we left Falmouth on an average we have marched 20 miles a day through heat. dust. rain and mud.  one day we marched just 35 miles the longest one in the army of potomac.  the general Comd Complimented us on it this Campaign has the hardest of the war.  in the last 30 days I have went through more hardships. than in the whole two years before it.  Still the Campaign is not over.  we are in line of battle but I think no danger.  there is one thing sure we Can not march a great many miles for the enemy is in our front and the potomac river is but a few miles from us.  I think this day will either place Lees army across the river or that their will be another great battle fought.  I hope it will be the latter for it will be the means of a total anhialation of Lees army and a speedy and to this war.  there was some very heay Cannonading upon the right this morning but all to is again quiet.  I am very much afraid that Lee will escape.  having nothing more to day I Shall close.  Hoping this will find you well and enjoying your Self this leaves me tired dirty and hungry but enjoying the best of health.  I think johny bingham ought to be ashamed of himself.  he ought to be banished out of the country.  he must be a miserable coward.  but he is not an american and must never critisise our generals in my presence or he will find him self in very hot quarters.  I Shall ever look upon him with disgust and Can never respect Such Cowards.  my respects to all my friends.  accept my best love I remain as ever your</br>

My dearest Emma</br>
</br>
Your ever welcome letter Aug 1st came to hand last I was very glad to See you So prompt in answering. but pon word Em.  I at one time thought you had forgotten that there was person Called Eddie out in the army.  the last letter from you was dated july 21st the one before that dated july 7th but the one dated 21st did not leavy New york untill july 29th leaving an interval of 22 days between the letters but all that has passed and every thing is again in working order So you feel Mad because Maguire has gone home.  why Em you ought to rejoice at his good fortune to get home Soon and not get angry.  remember he has a poor widow Mother and a sister who are very anxious to See him.  as your Mother was to See George and I have the Slighest doubt but what you would be very happy to See me home again.  but the fates willed it otherwise  I dont know but what it was all for the best.  for if I Should get home for a little while.  I would have to Come out again which would Make it very bad for us both.  I would rather go home and Stay.  Not Come out again but as George Says it is a good thing.  I recon it will be all of Sixty days before any of them gets back here and I Should like to be there as I want a great many little things which I Cannot get out here if I was there I recon me and George Could See the Elephant in a few weeks.  but as it Cant be there is no use of Crying over it, this cruel war will be over Some of these days.  but if we have Many Months like july. I recon it will make an old man of Me.  for the last three days. I have had just these Same pains and get a Stiff as an old man.  I recon it is a Slight touch of rhuematisms.  I hope you have Not Said any thing to George about them affairs of his regt.  I am rather inclined to think you have or he would note Spoke of it</br>
</br>
I am rather alarmed at your falling away So and would advise you to go to the Country for a Couple of weeks whther they Can Spare you or not at the Shop.  you go.  I just think that Shop is a killing you and all the girls in it.  I never had a very good opinion of its ventilation. its too close.  if you Should go in the Country and Stay any lenth of time why you Can write to Me there. and if you wish it I Could Send the answers to you.  Should there be a chance of My getting home for a few days why I Could easy find you and bring you back to the City in Short order</br>
</br>
So they have got My Name down to the Shop well Em I dont Care.  I am Not ashamed of it. I would Not Care of all the Shops in New york had a hold of it I recon wher that Man Butcher first Called you Edd.  you Started and Colored up. which Made him beleive all that was told him.  for if they told him Name thy Said More.  well he (Butcher) is not of much account and from what I Can learn. is a Man that will do all he Can to Curry favours from those under him and but if they are but to independant and keep him at a distant why he do all he Can against that person aint it So.  remember me to Louise George and all the rest.  hopeing this will find you in better health than when you wrote.  I wish it was fashionable to have young ladys visiting the army.  I would have you out here for a Couple of weeks riding horse back through the County.  that and boarding at a Country farm house would Soon bring back your lost flesh.  I boarded at a country house for three days and went a riding.  it was while on picket the house was my head quarters it was an estate Called pine view a very pretty place I was willing to Stay on picket for a week but they Could Not See it.  I guess I will close.  accept my best and Sincere love from yours truly Edwd C. Cauvet</br>
</br>
Em go in the country.   never Mind the Shop they Can do with out you for a Couple of weeks. but while there remember that there is Such a person out in the army as Eddie who takes a great interest in one Called Em.  and is always happy to hear from her  So wishing you a happy and pleasant time while amonst the trees and grass. I will Stop but dont forget to write and you will Confer a great favour on Eddie</p></div><div class = "letter"><h4>August 1, 1863</h4><p></br></br>Camp of the 42nd Regt</br>

I was taken rather by Surprise this evening by receiving a letter from you.  I had given up all hopes of receiving one and had thought you had given up all idea of writing to Me. I had almost made up My Mind Not to again write until I heard from you only think allmost a Month since I had a word from you.  but on account of the riot and sickness. I will excuse you and the long delay.  but Still I think you Might have Sent the letter by Some one to place it in the office and Not keep one So long without hearing from you</br>
</br>
I Could Not get home on Conscripts bill.  Maguire has went.  I am glad to hear that George has went home on it.  Now that the riot has Stopped. the will have gay times and I wish I was in some of their places.  as I am getting tired of this kind of life and world like to have a few Months of home.  but I dont See the way to it.  I Can not ever resign.  for they Send all officers and men that are Not fit for the field in to the invalid Corps.  I also understand that an officer has to Serve from three years from his last Muster.  that is his last promotion but I Cant See it if I am not out of the Service before the 22nd of june / 64.  I will go then and I dont think that goverment or any thing else Can hold me we are Camped about 19 miles from Falmouth or eight Miles from Kelleys ford.  have been here two days.  heard Some brisk Cannading this afternoon.  think it is the Cavalry No Signs of us Moveing nor am I very anxious this hot weather.  it is almost hot enough to Cook an egg in the Sun</br>
</br>
So you have Seen a taste of Camp life in New york. from all accounts Skirmishing was right heavy and Smart for Couples of days.  but the Union boys got the upper hand of them and every thing is again quiet I am in great hopes that it will be the Same way out here</br>
</br>
I am very Sorry to hear that you had the face ache again.  I thought you would not have that any More after having your teeth fixed.  I am happy to hear of it getting well and hope you never will be bothered with it again.</br>
</br>
I have no News of importance that would be of any interest to you So I Shall have to Conclude.  My best respects to George and your folks.  hoping this will find you all well as this leaves me at present.  with much love I now bid you a good Night with pleasant dreams.  I remain as ever</br>

Dear Em</br>
</br>
Your letter dated Sept 21st Came to hand last evening.  in it you Say you would like to know how you would or Could please Me when your writing to me dont do So.  but it Seems that you are labouring under a great Mistake for the More your write the better I like it but what did displease Me was your long Silence which Seemed to Me. as if you intended to Neglect Me while you were enjoying your Self.  you also Say that You do not think it was your place to write to me without receiving a letter first from me.  well Em from your last letter you Say you found three letters waiting at home for you when you returned.  So you See it was not my fault.  and another thing.  Considering the position. and relation we are to each other I think it would be proper for you to an write to Me.  especially when you go away from your home.  never given Me the adress of the place you was going too what would you think of Me. if I Should do So with you.  why you would think I did not Care any thing about you.  you Say if you Cannot please me by writing to me, you had better give it up as to that you Can use your own judgement.  I hardly think I ought to apologize.  for it Seems to Me that I am the one that is most aggrieved.  as for the interest I take in you it is unquestionabl.  for more interest I Could not take in any other person but you.  I know that you have placed an unlimited Confidence in Me.  but I hardly think I have abused it.  No do I ever intend to.  No Matter what takes place between you and Me.  but I Sincerly hope that every thing will pass over Smooth with us. and that we have No more Such wrongliy (or what ever you may Call it).  I was in one of My Mad Spells when I wrote my last letter to you and did not feel in the best of humor when we halted. after a days March dodging through the woods to keep out of the enemy Shells.  it was in Such a position I wrote that letter and you would have written one of the Same Style.  if I had not written to you in over five weeks.  but as we are both very touchy in our feelings. I think we had better try and be a little more agreeable in the future and forget the past.  I am Sure I wish it</br>
</br>
When I last wrote. we were expecting to have an engagement every Minute.  but it turned out to be nothing but Slight Skirmishing all afternoon & evening.  we are Still in the Same position So is the enemy.  but the picture pickets do not fire at each other.  but Converse quiet freely.  we have been under Marching orders with eight days rations.  but the bad news from Rosecrans in Tennesee has I think countermanded the order.  there is also a report that three Corps from this army is to be Sent to Rosecrans Support in fact the 11 & 12 Corps are Said to be already gone </br>
</br>
I am very Sorry to hear that your Mother is So Sick that you have to Stay home with her I Sincerly hope that this letter will find her again enjoying the best of health.  please give My best respects to George and Louisa I Should think it was about time that George get Some Conscripts for his regiment.  I have received (250) two hundred and fifty Substitutes for the 42nd Regt alias Tammay and just have enough to do at present. with over three hundred men and only Six officers.  the officer that went after Conscripts did not Come on with the men.  but when they Come back I Shall have a great deal more to do.  as I will then have to drill My Company and have to walk on Marches and Now I ride and do Nothing but take Command of the regt at parades marches &c. &c</br>
</br>
Having Nothing More to write about.  I Shall bring this to a close wishing to be remembered to all,  hoping this will find you enjoying the best of health as this leaves Me at the present time.  I remain with many respects and love yours at war</br>

Dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your letter dated Oct 1st Came to hand last evening.  So you think I was indifferent about writing to you Now I dont think I was.  for there was three letters for you to answer when you reached home.  I think it was all your fault.  if there was any.  just Suppose I would Not write to you for over a Month what would you think.  why you would think that I was tired of you and did not want to Correspond with you any More.  in the letter that I received before your going away you Said for Me to write home as usual and that you would Send to your fa Mother to forward them to you but it Seems you, in your Sojourn through the Country forgot every thing and because you did Not receive letters from Me.  you Made up your Mind Not to write untill I had written to you.  do you think that was jutice to Me or to yourself.</br>
</br>
The 2nd Corps was releived from the front yesterday by the 6th Corps.  we now expect to have a resting Spell for a few weeks at least.  it is Such an usual thing for them to releive a Corps from the front that there is all Sorts of rumors about us.  Some Say that we are going to Tennessee.  others Say Texas & washinton.  if we go any place it will be Tennesee to reinforce Rosecrans.  but I hope they will Not Send us anywhers for I am far enough away from home while in Virginia.  I guess we were releived on account of the hard duty we have been doing ever Since the army has been in this Vicinity</br>
</br>
There was a most terrible and foul Muder Committed. in our brigade on the night before last it was in the 20th Mass.  the officer of the day was ordering the lights to be put out after Taps. when Some feind from behind a tree Shot him through the left breast.  killing him almost instantly. the deed was done by one of this own regt.  a substitute.  the unfortunate officers Name was Captain McKay and was beloved by all who knew him and as brave a Soldier Never lived</br>
</br>
Our regt has received 255 Men Mostly all Substitutes.  we get along with them very well by Strict watching and being a little Severe. we do Not use them quiet as gently as we did Volunteers.  for the Most of these Men Sold themselves for $300 and Came out here with the intention of deserting or getting out of the Service Some way or another.  they even desert over to the enemy.  we have eleven deserters from our regt.  but we have Caught four of them.  who will have the pleasure of getting Shot or hanging.  I hope it will be the latter, they all had on a kind of a rebel Suit of Clothes when Caught.  we are expecting 340 more men this week.  Maguire has not arrived in Camp yet. our Colonel has Come back.  but he took Command of the brigade which leaves Me Still Commanding the regt.  if George has Not Started when this reaches. I wish, if you please to tell him to Call and See Me as I would like to See him very Much.  our Camp is about Mid way between Brandy Station & Culpepper or one Mile North of the latter place</br>
</br>
I am happy to hear that your Mother is getting better.  but Still Sorry to hear that Louisa is unwell.  my respects to them both.  you being away from the Shop So long will give them Suspicions (in fact I guess they are all Sure) that you are Married.  I Should think that you would not much like to go back.  but as you Say it dont pay to Stay at home.  I would like to help it if I Could for I do not like to See you go back.  but I Cannot See of any way at the present time. and if I Cant get up a Sick Some way or another. So as to resign I am afraid I will have to Serve two years from the 17th of last September.  which arrangement worries Me Considerable  I all most think I Shall get out dishonarable if they do Not let me go home when the old regt go term expires.  My health is very good in fact it is rather too good to Suit me at present.  hopeing this will find you and all your folks enjoying the best of health.  I will Conclude with many respect and love</br>

Em.  I hope you will excuse Me for what I am going to Say.  and that is that you had better not go out riding in that Carriage quiet So often for it has got to be the whole talk of the Neighberhood where you reside.  and now it is Coming out to Me.  and I fear that it will do you more harm than good.  Scandal will do a great deal.  especially amongst your own Sex.  when once they Commence it will be hard to Stop it.  Now I dont want you to deprive your Self of any enjoyment.  but this has put a damper on My Spirits.  for I am afraid that the busy tongue has allready gone to far.  Now dont be angry at the above words for it is not a demand.  but I ask it as a favour.  and by doing so you will greatly oblige your Eddy</p></div><div class = "letter"><h4>October 28, 1863</h4><p></br></br>Camp Near Warrenton Va</br>

Dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your letter dated Oct 25th arrived a few Minuets ago.  I was very glad to hear that you was well.  also that your Mother was better.  but I am very Sorry to hear that your Sister Louisa is again Sick.  I dont think. her working in that close Shop. will ever be any benefit to her health.  So you have again gone back to the Shop and Nothing Said about your going away for So long time I rather think you were favoured.</br>
</br>
Yes Em the army had a very hard time in the falling back from Culpepper to the works at Bull Run.  our Corps had the toughest part of it.  Some of it was fighting from day light untill dark. we had the rear guard.  I am very glad to hear that Col Mallon had a Nice and large funeral.  as he was a brave Man.  Still he done a great Many things to injure his own regt Such as Making New appointment from his own friends h in Civil life.  but the poor fellow is gone and those things Must be forgotten</br>
</br>
I am very Sorry to See you write So independant and reckless about what I Alluded to in My last letter and that if I was in New York. you would do the Same well you Can do just as you please. whether I am in or out of New york if you do Not Care about the public talk.  I am sure I aint a going to let it trouble Me any longer I did feel very Much hurt when I heard of it at first but I guess I will get over it.  you Say that you have kept yourself So Secluded in the house for So long a time that if you Now go out of the house there is a talk about it.  Now that is hardly So what has Caused the talk.  is Not you So Much. as it has been the different turn outs.  which you have been riding in.  as for Me I think My friends are true friends. and are perfectly justifiable in what they told Me.  they know perfectly well that I was true to you. and they Not knowing who it was. that you went riding with. thought it perfectly right in telling Me.  they never Said a word. in any way to injure your Character.  if they even thought Such a thing they would Note dare to express it too Me.  No Em you judge them too harshly.  they are perfect gentleman and what they Said was for the both of our interest. for they heard the people of your neighberhood expressing there Sentiments for Most of that part.  knew us both and that we kept Company together very Steady before the war.  and when I was home they remarked the Same thing.  I am Not a bit Surprised to hear of them talking So.  when they See you riding out quiet often with a Strange young Man whom know Nobody around there is accuanted the reason I Mentioned it too you was. that I thought you would Not like the talk Much.  Now that you now it.  I will Say No More about it.  I am extremely Sorry that I ever Said a word to you about it.  I am Sure I will Never Said Say anything about where you go.  you are old enough to Control your actions without telling Me or Asking My advice.  I would be very Sorry to hear of your removal in the Country.  but if you wish it.  why I Cant Stay it.  </br>
</br>
Well Em. the weather  here is getting very Cold I am very Much afraid that we will have a Severe winter. from all appearances.  we are about entering on another Campaign.  it will be an advance.  and we will See Some very tough times bivouacing with out tents these Cold Nights I wish this winter was over as it is My last one in the army.  I have just eight months to Sever to night.  when I again will be a free man and Not a hireling to be buffed about by a few imbeciles at Washington and Should I again go a Soldiering it will be in Some other Country for I am tired the way ours is Carried on.  why it has been a game of Tag between our Gens and Lee.  first one and then the other</br>
</br>
I Shall Now Conclude this long letter by expressing my regards to all your folks.  hoping this will find you and them enjoying the bets of health. as this leaves me at the present time.  with the assurance of My best love & wishes I remain Sincerly & truly yours</br>

Dear Emma</br>
</br>
Your welcome letter dated Nov 27th Came to hand this Morning.  I was very glad to hear from you.  and it is with the greatest of pleasure I Now answer it.  I would have written before but as our Communications were Stopped.  I Could Neither Send or receive papers or letters.  you Supposed in your last that I kept thankgiven day, well, yes.  I kept it in this way.  Started on the March before daylight.  crossed the Rapidam river and Camped three Miles the Other Side about 9. O clock at night.  My thanksgiven dinner Consisted of a few hard tack and Some raw ham Supper the Same with a little Coffee added in, that has been our bill of fare in the last Seven days Campaign.  with the exception of the last day and then we had Nothing to eat.  we did Not Accomplish Much in the last Move but for all that it was a very Severe Campaign.  our 42 loss was very Slight.  Considering we were in the front going and the extreme rear Coming back.  for we were on picket the army left at 9 O clock at Night.  and picket at three O. clock the Next Morning.  I Suppose the papers and people North are loud in denouncing Gen Meade for Not attacking Lee.  but if they Could once See what we had in our front.  they would thank him and Call him a wise Man for Not destroying his whole army.  I would give you details of the Move.  if I thought it would be interesting.  but as your knowledge in the art of war is limited.  I thought best to Not go in to details.</br>
</br>
I am very thankfull to you for taking the trouble to look in the papers for that Article from Conningham.  I recon it has never been published.  Should you ever See it or anything as else prertaining to 2nd division 2 Corps.  I you would oblige Me very Much by Cutting it out and Sending it to Me.  for we Seldom receive the Herald out here the Washington Cronicle is the army paper.</br>
</br>
I am very happy to hear that the recruits Come in very fast to Riker Island.  the Union wants them all three years troops.  times will expire in a few months.  George has had a pretty good thing On the Island.  I am very Sorry that I did not get going after Conscripts </br>
</br>
I hope that the Strikers in New York. both male and female Succeed.  for god knows Some of the latter wants it bad enough I thought you Could do better at the Work you was at.  and that it was easyer.  but if it dont agree with dont do it.  for I Shall be home in a few Months to Claim all promises as Soon as I get there.  if a Certain party is willing.  but Some how or another I think there is a kind of a Coldness on her part. which I can Not Comprehend.  but I will find out by an interview and Not by letters</br>
</br>
I Must have pretty Sharp eyes if I was the first that found out that you had Freckles on your face. but, if you remember, you told Me your Self that there was a few Freckles on your face</br>
</br>
I recon I have written nonsence enough So I Shall Conclude. remember Me to all folks hoping this will find you and them enjoying the best of health as this leaves Me at present  I remain with Much love your as</br>

My dear Em.</br>
</br>
Your Most and ever welcome letter dated Jan 3rd. was received by Me this evening with a great amount of pleasure.  I was very anxious to receive it. running to my old Camp for the last three day inquiring of there was any letters for Me.  but the answer was No.  I was very Much disapointed for I expected one from you.  in a Shorter time.  but Come to Count the days.  you Could Not have well Sent it Sooner but you  know Dear Em how anxious I felt.  after having been home and leaving you So Soon.  Not being with you half My time.  But that   was all through a MisunderStanding.  which I hope will Never happen us again.  you Say you expected a letter from me on New years eve.  well I thought Mine would reach you by that time.  So you did Not give Me up because it did Not reach you in time well Em I Should Not think you would, after that last evening talks.  if you Could Not put faith in Me after that.  why I Might as well.  give up alltogether and reenlist for three years more.  but I guess.  I Shall Not have to do that what Say you.  So you feel lonesome do you well you Can imagine My feelings now.  Coming away from all Society & pleasure.  while you are whee you See a different life alltogether.  you have your parks and Amusements to go to while I, if I want a ride. have to go up to the horses neck in Mud & ditches</br>
</br>
New Years in New York was rather a foggy day but out here it was very pleasant.  I enjoy Myself hugely.  I received an invitation from the commander of the brigade. to Call on him in full dress and Mounted at 11. O clock. which I did.  from there we went to division and to Corps and Severals other places. in fact we had a very excellant time. for the Army</br>
</br>
Dear Em all doubts about you not Sending that letter has disappeared.  So you need Not think of it any More.  the letter has Not arrived yet.  but if luck had Not Sent Me home on a leave of absence we would have been as Strangers to day.  and we would have both be too Stubborn to write again.  I am perfectly willing to write two. yes four letters if you will do the Same.  Should My answers Not reach you.  I Should have written this evening if I had Not received yours.  Should we ever be Seperated it will Not be My fault.  So remember I Shall allways look for your letters as our promised was.  Soon as they begin to lag behind time.  I Shall think you are getting Careless and Not interested. which will Most assuredly Make Me the Same You Say you are waiting patiently for those Six Months to pass.  but Not More So than I am.  I have two very Strong reasons for wishing it.  one is too get out of the Service and the other you are perfectly accuanted with</br>
</br>
I am very Sorry to hear that Louisa is Sick.  She had better take good Care of herself.  for her Constutution is Not the Strongest in the world.  the first thing She knows will be that She will be Consumptive.  that So. I have seen a great many like her. I am very Sorry I Could not have Staid over New Yrs.  to Call on you.  god knows I wanted too bad enough.  but I had a reputation out here which I did Not want lessoned one Mite.  but wanted to build it up.  which I think I am doing.  I was Not back 30. hours before I was detailed to Command the 7. Mich Battalion.  Since I have been detached from Brigade.  to Command the above Battalion and the 53 Battalion of Penn Vols and am Now Comdg the Prov guard of the 2nd Army Corps.  it is a big thing for Me Nothing to do with Splendid quarters and an excellant Mess.  No. picket.  Guard or fatigue dutys for me to do.</br>
</br>
I am very glad to hear that you want to See Mrs. Grahams. for She thought it was very Strange you did Not Call. you did Not hear any thing bad of Me at the ball.  I guess. did you for I was like an old back there</br>
</br>
My dear Em as there is Not much News.  I Shall bring this to a close with My kind regards to all at 633. with Sincere and Much devoted love I remain yours Most </br>

</br>
My dear Em,</br>
</br>
I Suppose you will be Surprised at receiving this letter but Not Me so than I was this Morning at receivng one from you when the agent Came to me this Morning and handed Me a letter directed in your well known welcome hand writing.  I was astonished and wondered what was the matter.  I was allmost afraid to open it.  for fear of Some disagreeable News.  I felt a little flighty about it I assure you. I hurried to my tent. where I would be alone and tore open the letter when lo and behold it was dated Dec 9th 1863.  you Can udge how wide My eyes opened then.  Says I this is the long Missing letter and I how wrongly I judged dear Em when I was home but thank god I did get home at that time.  I think kind providence had a hand in Sending Me home at that very time it Saved us from being total Strangers. which would have Surely been the Case. and I think that every thing between us will now turn out as we wish it after the above.  but Suppose I had Not went home at that time and our Correspondence had Ceased just on account of that one fatal letter.  what would have been My feelings to day when it Came or hear after.  I Could Never have Met you any wheres but what I would think of what a grevious wrong I had done you, of Course I Could have written an apology if My Stubborn pride would have allowed it than again I well suppose I had written one to you to receive in after I had so shamefully treated you I know it is a hard thing for Me to apologize. but I am going to do it and I ask ten thousand pardons for the hard feelings I Caused you in the first path of My visit to New York I know I did Not treat you as I ought to have done but you know the Circumstances and how quick I am to take any thing up. So you will pardon Me. and I assuume you that I Shall never have the Same Mistrust again without abundant proof.  which I Never Shall get and I think every thing will work Smooth with us here after.</br>
</br>
It Came pretty hard for Me to acknowldge the receipt of the long Missing letter. but I thought  it due you. and Could not rest all day for thinking of it.  I was agoing to wait until I answered your Next letter. but My patience Conscience or what ever you have a Mind to Call it would Not let Me So I Set down and Scribbled this letter off and hope it will be received with as Much glassness as it is written in.  yes dear Em you Cannot imagine how glad I was to get that letter in fact I would rather have it than a hundred dollars. for it makes the Number for 1862 complete</br>
</br>
This letter being So long on the way is a good lesson to both of us. and it Shows how very foolish we would be. to get on our dignity because either one of us wrote the last letter.  dear em I assure you after this, before I give you up I Shall write three or four letters to your and I wish you to do the Same with Me. will you for we dont know what May happen. Now Em I dont want the Curtain licture for My doubting you of Sending the letter as the letter itself has punished Me enough for it in fact I feel a little Mean about it but they day an open Confession is good for the Soul</br>
</br>

My dearest Emma</br>
</br>
Your kind. pleasant and ever welcome letter dated jan 25th arrived last evening.  indeed I was very happy to receive it in So short a time.  your last was delayed in the Corps Post office and Not in New york as you supposed.  they keept it for two days forgetting all about me.  it will Not happen So again.  they are very particular about My letters Now.</br>
</br>
So you think I am rather hard on you hey but you know dear that I do Not Mean one half of what I Say.  only when I Say I love you.  then I Speak truly and Sincerely you Say you are to Much wrapped up in Me. to forget Me.  I believe you My dear.  the Same here.  I Should just liked to wrap these arm around you this Minuet. and I think I would be one of the happiest fellow living. dont you think So too dear</br>
</br>
I wish you was in Some of the ladies places out here.  No. No. I dont wish any Such thing for I Could Never See you another Mans wife.  but this is what I wish.  that you was My wife and on a visit out here too Me.  Oh if it was only so what a gay. happy. & jolly time we would have together and you Say you Can ride horse back a little.  that would by bully for me Could trot all around the Country.  but why linger on impossibilitys.  it only Makes Me feel home Sick. and wonder when that happy day Shall arrive.  that I Can Call you Mine.  I often think of it.  when Setting in My tent Meditating Some times I think it will Never Come but I think that if god is willing and you Coincide with him. it will take place in 1864</br>
</br>
You Say if I tell you too Much about the Ball that you will get jealouse.  Now dear I allways Supposed that you were Not of a jealous disposition.  and that if I had So Choosed. I Could have run around talked and danced with Most any young lady and that you would look on with perfect indifference. but I begin to See that you are a little inclined to be jealous.  but then dear there is No true love without jealousy.  but you Need Never fear of Me Em.  I shall Not knowingly give you Cause for to be jealous</br>
</br>
So you were around to Grahams last Sunday evening. and Say if I had been to N.Y. that you would not have went around.  I rather think you wouldnt. for you would not have been able to Stir out of your house. on account of being chained fast.  by an arm around your Neck and a young Mans head pretty close to yours. of Course No kissing would be allowed.  that would be ruled out of the programme alltogether.  dont you think So Em.  I think I Can hear you Say yes.  over the left.  I just wish I could See you for one Minuet only.  for I want to See you very Much</br>
</br>
The weather is beautifull. for over a week it has been like the weather in june the roads are dry and good Nights are beautifull clear Moon light. just Such ones as we used to like to take a walk and talk of I want Say what</br>
</br>
I guess Mrs Woods does Not think any thing about your Not going with her to the S. party and the reason you did Not get an invitation to the last was because you did Not go to the first.  I dont think you lost any thing by Not going</br>
</br>
There is No News of any description out here So you Must over look this letter and accept with My best and kind love the best wishes. kisses. & &. and ever believe Me to be truly yours and yours Only</br>

My dearest Emma</br>
</br>
Your kind and ever welcome letter dated New york jan 28th arrived.  Supposing that you would like to hear from Me as often as possible I thought I would answer it right.  I am glad that you think of me Some times when you are Not expecting a letter but I thought Sure that the letter would surprise you a little. but I am very glad it did Not for I do Not like Surprises very Much but Now you will think I am hinting on Surprise partys because you Spoke of one in your letter. well dear I Cant Say that I favour them Much.  especially when they take place at the engine houses.  but if you did go to one I would rather it would take place at the house of Hook & Ladder Company No 14. than any other house of that description.  that is if the Company is the Same as it was when I was home.  (Before this war Commenced).  I have Seen a great deal of them partys and have heard a great deal More about them and I am Very Certain. that if I was home. that I Should Not take you to one. in fact I would just as leave take you to one of S Williams hops. and you know that I would Not do that. for I know to well what they are. and So do you Still we would not like to go again. like we used too when we were young and unsophisticated for it aint the right Style as the boy Said. Never Mind dear wait patiently for a little while I am Coming home Next Month for 15 days.  the latter part of it .  So look out and give Me a good reception. this time and I will guarantee that we will enjoy our Selves and Not have over a dozen pouting Matches</br>
</br>
You tell Me I Need Never fear of your deceiving Me that way.  for if you wanted to do So. why you Could have done it when in the Country.  Now I have Surely puzzled My brains trying to find out what way you Mean for I dont remember of Saying anything about you deceiving Me in My last.  And I am Sure I did Not Say any thing about your Country trip last. for I Never Mention or think of it on account of what happened that time.  I am Not Much afraid of you deceiving Me for I dont think you would do So Now.  but if you would do Such a thing and I found it out.  it would be all up with us and our Nice prospects Next fall.  but I guess there is No fear of that dear neither one </br>
</br>
My prospects in this position are very good.  I think I Shall be here untill My term of Service expire which will Clear Me of any fights Next Summer if any.  I got a New horse to day a fiery animal.  and I expect he will break My Neck if I ant Carefull.  but I do So like a spirited animal.  two weeks ago he threw a Colonel and broke four of his ribs.  pleasent prospects for My ribs hay dear.  but what is to be will be.  but you never will believe that</br>
</br>
The ball room for the corps ball is progressing it takes place on the 22nd of Feb.  Old Abe & Mrs L is too be at it. and I think young Ned and Miss K will be enjoying them Selves as Some ball in NY about that time.  Go get up your best Smiles for the Occasion.  So No More at prest my dear love and accept the best wishes. respects. and affectionate love from one that is ever thinking of thee</br>

My dearest Emma</br>
</br>
Your ever kind and Most welcome letter dated Feb 1st arrived a few minuets ago.  I was indeed truly happy when I See your well known hand writing on the envelope. it Seems to Me that I am Continually looking for letters from you. last evening I was quiet disapointed when the Mail arrived. and No letter from you and I was perfectly aware that the letter which yours was an answer to would Not reach you before Monday the 1st.</br>
</br>
So you would Not object to My arm around your Neck and would rather like it.  well dear.  you Can believe Me or Not. but I assure that I would be the happiest of Men if I Could do that Same thing at present.  the Motto at the head of your letter is very appropriate but how would it be My dear Em. if it was in a gilded palace.  I admit those little Shats we used to have were exceedingly disagreeable to Me and Ive no doubt that they were the Same to you.  but you know dear that the Noble blood that is in us would Not allow the least Slight on either Side to pass unoticed but No More of them for Me if you please.  My Motto hear after is ,,Strive to please those we love. how is that darling. do you take up the Same Motto.</br>
</br>
You Say Never Mind. but wait patiently and that you will be Mine.  but I Must confess that it is you that has waited patiently. and I have kept you waiting.  if I had been half of a Man I Should insisted on you to Marry me over a year ago. but I feared to do So. for fear that Some thing dreadfull would happen to me while in the Service.  and instead of a life of happiness which Should be yours.  it Might be that of a life of Misery but Em. I dryed tried to do My best for your own welfare as well as my own. in all but one thing. and that was. I had No right to hold you to any promises when I Came out to the war.  Still all May be fore the best. and we May enjoy Many happy years together.  I like you all the better for you being a little jealous as if all goes to prove that your love is Sincere I dont Suppose it is any use to tell you I am a little jealous of you. for I dont believe you would believe Me. after last Summer Ha Ha Em. No Im Not a bit jealous.  but dont let Me See any body trying the affectionate with you. or I Might be the least bit So.</br>
</br>
I expect there will be a great Many at that Ball you Mentioned.  I have heard of it from two or three different partys.  if you had went to it.  I Should have heard all about you. even to your dress.  in fact every thing you had on.  and all your actions would have been telegraphed to Me So you See what interest Some folks take in us dear.  More than I like.</br>
</br>
I live in great hopes of Seeing you by the 22nd of Feb. if the Genl only knew how bad I wanted to See you.  he would Not hesitate one instant in letting Me go home. to embrace you.  if I Should Come home.  I wish you to remember that I Shall Not go to a Single ball. as I think we are getting too old to go to Such places.  I have changed My Mind Since I last wrote to you and am thinking about Settling down in to a Sober. Steady. Man. what do you Say dear.  is it a go.  remember Me to all your folks.  and accept the pure and best love of your devoted</br>

</br>
Your ever kind and welcome letter dated Feb 4th arrived a few minuets.  I was indeed happy to receive it.  I am glad that you are So prompt in Answering My letters and that you dont want to disapoint me if you Can help it.</br>
</br>
Well dear I am afraid. that I Shall Not be very apt to take your advice in regards . to riding that horse. for I am in love with him and he rides So beautifull. never Needing a Spur or whip. but just chirp and he is off.  I have nothing else to do but ride. and who wants a horse that one is continually Sticking a Spur into or beating him with a whip.</br>
</br>
Well Emmy dear I Never thought that you would ever give in. to ,, what is too be will be,, but I Cant See how a person Can get ahead of that. and dear if you Can Convince Me the way it is done Ill Surrender.</br>
</br>
Yes Em that Ball of this Corps will be a grand affair.  the 3rd Corps was a failure. but No pains is Spared to Make this one of the finest ever got up in that Style.  I wish I Could So Manage it that I Could bring you out to it. and go back home with you. if it was Not for talk in New york.  I would ask you to Come it would take three Nights and two day to Come to the ball and go immediatly back.  the first night would be in the Cars to Washington.  next day would take up most of the time to get to the army. and that Night the ball. the Same time to return.  I only wish I Could have you here for it the ball rooms is too be 60 ft by 90. about the sise of Irving hall.  with these Splendids Bands of Music.  the supper is to Cost $2.000.  it is really too bad that it is So far off.  if it was in Washington we Could do it right handy for we Could Come out in the day time and return the Next day being it Cant be So Ill try and be home at that time Still I hardly like to Miss the Corp ball. it will be some thing to be in history. as Most of the high Officials will be at it.  but I must Stop writing about it. or you will think I have the ball on the brain</br>
</br>
Em you will never learn to Skate.  excuse Me for Saying it. you are both too tall and heavy. ever to Make a gracefull Sakter.  and you had better Sell your Skates and buy a hymn book and go to Church So when I leave this army you Can reform me. for I assure you I Need it very Much. in fact I am getting demoralized out here. and expect you take Me in hand Next fall. but remember it will be a lifes job.  think you Can undertake it dear</br>
</br>
I am very lonesome here at present.  the Corps went on a recconnisance yesterday. they left all tents Standing.  So I had to Stay with head Quarter Guard to protect property and take Care of prisoners what is Sent in from the front.  yesterday had quiet a Skirmish. received 27. men and two officers as prisoners last Night.  taken at Morton Ford.  I took the officers under My Care. gave them Supper and drink.  Making them promise to Not attempt to escape.  I allowed them to Sleep in My tent.  this morning Sent them to Army Hd. Qrs. it is the first time that I have had any of the johnys in My quarters. one of them insisted on Me taking one of there $10.00 notes thinking that I Should exchange one of ours for it.  I took his. but I did not See giving him a green back. remember me to all your folks.  and accept the Most kind love and any Number of kisses from your affectionate and devoted</br>

My dearest Em</br>
</br>
Your Most kind and pleasing letter arrived this minuet and I hasten to answer it.  I am Most happy to receive it and you Cannot imagine what a weight it has taken off of My Mind. when you Say you will give me your word and honor that you will Never do So again. and for god Sake Em dont break your word.  Should I ever find out that you have used any deceit with Me. from the date of your letter.  hear after it will be the Means of upsetting Me Completely.  but No I Must Not talk So. for I have every trust and confidence in you Now.  but to tell the truth.  My Mind has been in an unsettled State ever Since My Visit to you. in fact I have been Sick.  Not in body but in heart.  So Much So that all My friends has Noticed it and have been Continualy asking Me if it was so.  My answer was No but I had No life in Me.  I was dull. and low Spirited. My Lieut even invited a party of friends over to the tent to wake Me up. as he Called it.  but it was anything but enjoyment to me  I Could Not get over our last Night together  I found Myself continually thinking even for hours after I went to rest.  Saying to Myself. how do I know but what Em has deceived Me in other instance as you Cannot imagine My feelings.  when alone every thing we had ever Said and done has Came before Me in the last four days.  dear Em. I Shall tell you every thing that has passed through Mind since leaving you and I assure it has been the hardest four days ever I passed through.  I have written Six letters to you Since Coming back. and have burnt them up again.  So you Can imagine how My feelings were.  I Shall tell the purport of what those letters amounted to. they were asking you to release Me from all engagements.  promises &c. untill this war was over.  (I had partially Made up My mind to See the war out).  So that you Could Mingle in the gay and giddy world in which you are in the Midst off.  after it was over.  I intended to go back to New york for a Month or so.  that is if Nothing happened me. and Seek you out. if you were Married or keeping Company with any one I Should have immediadtly left for California  My Lieut thought I was dazy when writing the letters and burning them up.  little did he think what my feelings.  when he was joking Me.  asking Me if it was a proposal.  and all Such Sort of Stuff.  you Say dear Em that if knew your feelings.  that I would Not be So hard on you that Night.  I am Sorry I was So.  but I was touched to the Core  I little thought you would have treated Me the way you did.  and I Said to myself I shall never trust woman. again. for they are Not to be trusted. I thought you of all living beings in the world.  I Could trust but Oh what were My feelings when I found you deceiving me Em.  I Cannot express it words. and it is too horrible to think of again.  and I wish ever to forget it.  and I shall forget it.  and will will place the fullest Confidence hope. trust and love in you again but for god Sake Em be Carefull and do not trifle with Such love and affection as I have for you.  I thought I loved My Mother. but it was No Such love as I have for you.  Man Could Not love woman with More affection and Sicerety that I do you.  but it is a love that is pure and very easy touched.  and when it is Slighted why there is No knowing what May become of it.  you have only My word for this.  Still I think My actions in the past Six years is proof enough that I Speak the truth. I know very well that the feeling is reciprocated.  or I assure you I Should not write Such a letter and I hope hearafter.  My dear there will be No cause for the Slightest Suspicion on either part.  but that every thing we Say or do will promote happyness but if it Cannot be So. My dear Em.  the Sooner we give up all pretensions towards each other the better.  Still I see No reason why we Should Not be happy.  I assure I Most heartyly wish it.  for if I Cannot be happy with you.  I Shall See but very little happyness in this world.  So My dear Em from this out lets us try and do all in our power.  to please each other.  I guess I have written enough on this Subject.  Still I Could write all day on it.  for My dearest interests are in it.</br>
</br>
There has been two exhibitions at the Hall this week.  one of them ending with a dance I went to both to drive dullness off.  but My enjoyment was Not such that I would have had if you had been with me.  or even if I had left you in the Same Spirit I did. a year ago.  I danced once about the third of a redova.  that was all the dancing I done the Hall was tore down to day</br>
</br>
You Say you feel low spirited and dont know what makes you feel So.  well I suppose it was the Same feeling I had.  but I think after receiving your letter and writing this.  I will be another man.  I have a very heavy Cold.  which will soon work.  I Suppose I Caught Sleeping in a tent after leaving the warm houses at home.  I wish I Could be again there if for only one night So as to have a good talk with you.  but I dont think it Can be untill Summer.  when I hope to Come for good.  remember me kindly to all your family.  I Shall Now close with confidence love. and affection.  ever believe Me to be truly and sincerly yours</br>

My dearest Emma</br>
</br>
Your kind. pleasing and ever welcome. was received by Me Not two minuets ago. and I hasten to answer it you Cannot imagine what amount of pleasure and happiness you letters give Me especially when written in the Strain your last one was Still I felt very bad when reading part of it. and that was where you Seemed to doubt My love for you and Say that there was a time when I would Not have wanted to be released from all promises and engagements.  Now dear Em you Misjudge Me.  My love for you has Never been More affectionate Sincere and true than it is at this present Moment.  No dear Em. it was My love for you. that Made Me think of asking you to release Me but you Cannot imagine what it would have Cost Me a life of Misery and god knows what else.  I Should have never thought of keeping Company with another lady with the intentions of getting Married.  you also speak of My talking So. and My time So Near out.  Now My dear Em.  let Me tell you once More. that all promises I made you was in good faith and I was Sincere in them and Shall keep Most Sacredly Should they not be kept.  I think it would be your own fault.  I assure I have No wish to with draw any thing I ever Said to you. without it is your positive wish.  then of Course I Should Not intrude.  but I have ever been looking forward Since I have been in the Service. to the day when my time would be out.  So that I Could claim you as My own.  I Should have insisted on our being Married when I was home at different times.  but I knew that I had to again Come back here and be in battle. and Should I ,, which is a plausible enough,, lose any of my limbs. be disfigured or be killed.  it would be dragging you along with Me into a life of Misery.  Now dear Em.  I have Never give you Cause to doubt my love. but have allways given you proofs that I did love.  and that it was a true love and it Cuts very deep.  when I think you doubt it.  My dear Em you ask My opinion and advise on a question Concerning us both. which I Shall Most happyly answer and Sincerely hope that you will be governed by it.  it is this whether you will tell your Mother or Not of our engagement.  Now dearest. it had allways been My wish.  (which you know) for your Mother to know of our engagement.  but you allways felt Shy when I spoke about it too you.  and Said that you did Not like to tell her.  but you would tell her and only her.  just before our Marriage. dear Em I wish you lose No time in telling her for I think it your duty to your Mother and if any one has a right to know it is a Mother.  Now please let her know all and every thing.  I Shall feel better to know that you have done So.  and So will you. of Course you will feel embarrassed. while telling her.  but after it is told.  you will have you will have her opinion of Me. and if it is favorable you will then enjoy her full Confidence and She yours. which will make it More pleasant for both and especially for you a daughter Must have the Confidence of a Mother.  when about being married. Emmy dear make a Confidant of your Mother as Soon as possible but do not let the rest know too Much I dont Care if the whole world knows of our engagement.  there is Nothing in it I am ashamed off.  No Not by any Means but feel proud of it.  you Say your Mother does Not know of our engagement.  Emma She knows just as well as if She was told of it and So does every body else. do you Suppose that She would allow Me for one instant to Set up with you after two O clock. or would She Call you up out of your bed (She knowing at the Same time that you had No Sleep for a week) to See me.  Now Emy dear She allowed and done both of these things for us.  on the two last nights I was in New york. Still you Never told her in words that it was So. but our actions have Shown it to her.  and the reason She Says all these things is that She wants her daughters Confidence which is her right when She has that.  She will Council you in any thing you wish or ask.  and will be of great assistance which you will Need very Much. as you are alone. and must have Some one to help you.  and who is More fitted to do than a Mother.  you Say you are afraid to tell Some things to any body else but me.  yes Em there is a great many things.  I Suppose. that you would Not like to ask me about.  which if you had your Mother Confidence you Could go to her and fell More Confidence in your Self.  So I again ask you to tell your Mother every thing what has between us. and I Shall feel More happy in knowing you have told her.  for I know it will be of great assistance and benefit to you</br>
</br>
Yes My dear Em. your last two letters have given Me More Confidence in you than ever.  My love for you has increased ten fold. and I place implicitate trust and Confidence in you hear after and I am Sure you try and do all in your power to promote happyness between.  I assure I think of Nothing else but of you and the 28th of june.  So Em bear up with Me untill then. at which time. I hope we Shall both be together Never again to Separate.  but Oh dear Em to anything happen or transpire with your Self let Me know it from your own lips or by your pen. and Not let Strangers herald it to Me.  for another blow like that last one would be the Means of Seperating us for ever.  I have over looked all the past. and am Now looking Steadily into the bright future. when I expect to be happy and Make others ones the Same.</br>
</br>
I am in excellent health and Spirits and Sincerly hope this will find you like wise.  there is Nothing of importance going on in the army So I have Not much News to write about Still My letters is Not a very short one. but it is one that I take a great pleasure in writing and I hope it will give the receiver as Much pleasure as the writer.  I wish to be remembered to all your folks.  So Now My dear Em I will bid you good evening. and ever believe Me to be truly and Sincerly. your most</br>

I think and hope to be with you this fourth of july in a Civilians dress. with the Soldiers clothes thrown a Side for ever I am getting tired of this business. and wish to do Some thing else I guess if I leave Soldiery I Can Make a living at Some thing else at least I think So.  I allways done it before and I dont See why I Cant do it again.  there is one Sure thing and that is I will never beg.  while I Can raise one hand up. So My dear you think I am a perservering young Man.  I thank you for the Compliment and hope I Shall Never give you Cause to think otherwise of Me.  but Emmy dear aint you getting tired of waiting for Me now tell the truth.  the reason I Said it all laid with you or Not whether I would be a Soldier was Not because I was afraid I Could Not make a living for Ive No doubt on that.  but that I Can.  but I was afraid of another quarrell between us.  which I Could Not bear.  So you are glad I Stopped drinking.  well its a fact. Nor will I touch a drop of Spiritous liquors again while I am in the Service. which will only be about three Months yes My dear Em.  I Said I would Never go a Shopping with you and I Meant what I Said not even to buy that wedding dress.  for I would be afraid you or rather we would have bad luck with it.  I Should like to go with you very much.  but I dont think I will. but we will See Next july.  I am very Sorry aye allmost angry with you that you did Not tell you Mother of our engagement I Cant See why you did Not.  I dont like this keeping back what you which to tell. Emmy dear do tell her.  I am allmost inclined to writer her a letter telling her every thing.  I dont See why you are So afraid of it being known.  Not that I would tell any without your Consent.  but it Seems to Me that you lack Confidence in Me. and afraid that I will Not fullfill My engagements or you are afraid that Some will Come between us and Seperate us Em let me have your Confidence and tell what it is you dread So Much or that your are afraid off the whole world or at least they that know us. are aware that we are engaged.  just as Much as if we had told them. they know perfectly well that you would Not keep your Self So Secluded. or that I when home would run around More.  if we were Not engaged.  Suppose you see a Couple do the Same as we have done.  what would be your opinion. Now Emmy the Next letter I receive from you. I want to hear that you have told your Mother.  I am very Sorry to hear of little jimmys Grahams death.  it is horrible and dreadfull to think of.  he being killed in that way.  and he was Such a bright and Smart Child.  jimmy and Mrs Graham will miss that boy. and I shall Miss him when i get home  I Cannot hardly realize it you speak of St. Patricks day in New york. but I wish you Could have Seen it out here.  the day was a beautifull one. the Irish Brigade had allsorts of Sport that day.  I Set on My horse witnessing the fun for over five hours. I thought it would never get over with it.  after it was over there was a gay banguet.  where good things disappeared in a double quick time.  toast. Songs and Speaches were the order of the day untill they all were to happy and full to Say any more.  theres also a lady out here given lectures.  the Said lectures amounting to Nothing but Niggerism and abusing every body but Abraham Lincoln.  if it had been a Man speaking he would have been hooted out of the hall. but you know My dear that a woman Can say anything amongst gentlemen.  well Em you Can have drops taking off of the ear rings. but have done So that they Can be put on a gain. for you May wish them on Some of these days.  or May be you Could exchange them for a Set that would Suit Countenance and fancy much better I wish you to Statisfied your Self on it.  and it will Suit Me. Em I wish to ask you one question have you taken your hair to have a chain made for me. No Ill bet you never have given it a thought.  I dont know as I have anything More to Say.  So I will now close.  My best wishes to all your folks good Night.  My emma dear.  pleasant dreams and Sweet repose and ever believe Me to be with Much love your true and devoted</br>

It is Now 10 days Since I had a letter from you and I feel very anxious about it and think of all Sorts of things happening to you  I Should have written yesterday. but I have been So busy lately.  that My time has been pretty well occupied.  I had to attend too three different departments on account of the absence of the provost Marshall and the Consolidations of the Corps.  but every thing has become Settled and I have again Settled down to My usual life of idleness.  which gives Me time to ponder and think of your letter. and wonder whether you are Sick or any accident happened to you or whether you have Sent the letter and it has Miscarried or been lost if the latter be the Case.  I wish you to write immediatly.  if you are Sick and unable to write. let Some one write a few words for you but any how let Me hear from you in Some way.  for I Cannot Stand this uncertainty.  I have Nothing of importance to to Communicate to you.  I Still retain My position.  I See the official Notification of Gen Hancocks Staff and My Name was on it.  I am Now permanently detailed. be So kind as to excuse this Short Note and ever believe Me to be with Much love yours truly</br>

Your kind. welcome but Anxiously looked for letter arrived this afternoon.  I assur you it gave Me Much joy as I had allmost given you up.  I tell you I Counted every day.  but None Came.  if I had Not received your letter I dont know what I Should done.  as this was the 17th day without hearing one word from you  I thought Sure if Nothing was the matter that you would write on the 10th day.  So you Can imagine how I felt over it.  My Mind was full of doubts.  fears and Suspicions.  I was all time picturing Some thing in My Mind that was dredfull.  I dont think it was right in you for too let the tenth day pass without Sending Me a few works.  Now my dear Em if you break through the promises we Made. why you Must Not expect Me to keep them.  Now I wish you would that is if you do Not hear from Me. write on the tenth day.  and I Assure you I will by So doing we will Save each other many unpleasant feelings. doubts and Misunderstandings  I dont know how it is but you Seem to be afraid of writing Me a letter More than I do you.  Suppose I was the Same way what would we then do.  I am Sure a lady in your position to a gentleman as you are to Me. Need be afraid of any impropriety of writhing a letter without having one to answer it from. the Next time you write one why put it in the post. not wait from day to day with the expectations of receiving one.  I am Sorry the letters is lost. for I expected an answer to a question In it. but Nothing of it is Mentioned in your last</br>
</br>
Indeed I am very glad that you have told your Mother of our engagement.  but I thought Surely that when you need broached the Subject to her. that you would tell her all you wished.  but dear Em I believe you are a Coward.  So your Mother did Not Say Much. and that She expected it.  well that is just the way I expected her too be a little Serious. and thoughtfull but She will Speak too you again on the Subject.  after She has taken time to Study all My bad & good traits in My Character.  you May depend upon it she is Analysing Me. and As far as She knows. She will have Me down as fine as the point of a Needle.  So look out fore a good long talking Some of these days on a Subject Called Eddie.  so She thinks I am Smart I thank her for the Compliment.  also that I have an awfull temper.  She Never Spoke a truer word in her life and I am very Sorry to give her Cause to Say So.  I wonder I dont get in More trouble.  when I look back and See how the pleagued thing Carrys Me through every thing.  I Never get in trouble but keep gaining friends and Never lose old ones  Still I dont think your Mother Can have Objections on that Score.  for all She has to do is too look at her own family and See their tempers.  especially yours  I tell you Em you showed it to me one night when I was home last.  and I think we are Sins onthat</br>
</br>
The Sanitary fair of New York is Making a great Stir in the circles of New York.  but from what I Can understand the price of admission is so high that all Classes Cannot afford to pay it.  also that to See the different departments you have to pay extra at each place</br>
</br>
There is no News of importance to write to you.  I have been releived of My old guard and received in place one hundred (100) Men. a Captain & Lieut. which gives Me a larger Command of both Officers and Men Still for all that I would much prefer having the old guard.  as it is Now.  I Shall have to Commence all over New to get the new men to understand their dutys. and I have very little time to do it in. for the army will Move as soon as the weather permits.  it has rained for four Strait days.  cleared up this morning.  but looks like rain again</br>
</br>
I have Nothing More to write So I Shall Conclude with the best wishes & respects to all your folks. and the true and best love of your devoted Eddie who hopes this will find you enjoying the best of health as it leaves him.  good Night My dear Em and pleasant dreams and dont forget to remember me in them as I do you.  I remain truly and only yours</br>

My dear dear Em</br>
</br>
Your very good Natured and Most pleasing letter of the 15th inst. has just this Minuet arrived.  and I assure I answer it with the greatest amount of pleasure imaginabl.  I dont See what great troubles we have had. that you talk about.  It was all your own fault.  I have done Nothing that you Could blame me for.  with out it was getting angry with you once in awhile.  I have Never disapointed or Neglected you in any one thing and allways tried My best to please you in every thing.  you Can look back at My record for the last Six years and point out to Me any one instance where I did Not try My best to please you. So you often hear Folks Say that the only way to Cure lovers from quareling is too get Married.  and you kinder think it is true.  but Not Certain.  and that you will tell Me better after you are Married. well I dont Care Much about what folks Says on any Subject like that.  but I hope that Such is the Case.  So you think that you would like to go on that trip with Me and My friends Next Summer well I Should very Much like to have you along My dear, but remember it will have to be as Mrs Cauvet.  Not Em Knight There is No time Settled yet Nor do I think there will be untill I get home.  Most every thing lays with Me and the time I get out of the Service So My dear Em. hurry up those little fixing of yours. and dont attempt to delay our proposed excursion but I hardly think that when we once Set the time to go. that you Nor any body else will put it back. and Spoil all. So you think it foolish for Me to go, Come back and go again.  thank you for thinking So. but allow me to differ with this once.  if there had Not been ladys proposed on the trip.  I assure I would have went. No Matter what you Sayed to the Contrary.  and you Must remember that it would have been My last trip in Single harness and I would wish to enjoy it. for after that I shall allways go in double harness. that Means where one goes the both goes. but as they proposed ladys and was So kind as to Mention you.  I of Course Could have No Objections to Crinoline being in the party.  but I assure I wanted it to be a Bachelor trip as I wanted to go a good Many places where it would be inconvenient for ladys to travel very well.  but I Suppose My plans for the Campaign will have to be altered Some what.  I wished to Visit Philadelphia. Baltimore and Washington then through Maryland into Pensylvania home. but Now I suppose we will have to go to the Lakes.  you give Me good encouragement indeed for to get Married. telling Me about those enormous high rents &c &c I begin to feel a little afeard. and think I had better give up all thoughts of Matrimony for a time and Stay for a Soldier. but you Say Never Mind I have plenty of Money.  dont let that idea run away with you Em for I have but little which will Soon run out after I get you. then again I dont intend to live in New York if I can help it.  My Brother (Henry) has bought a place up in the Country and has Moved his family into it.  I told him if he Seen an opening for a young Man up there for to let Me know.  I dont think I would like to live in New york and work at My trade.  Nor will I if I Can help it.  So you think you are going to be rich before you die.  I recon you will have to live to be a very old woman. it Must be So. if Some thing tells you So.  and I hope it will be So. and that I will have the pleasure of helping you to invest your Money at interest Nothing like it Em.  go to work and dream of Mountains of gold.  I did Not get going to Baltimore as I expected I thought Sure I was going the Provost Marshall & Adjt Gen of the Corps was willing but when old Gen Hancock was asked. he Said No. that I Must take care of My guard. I had every thing ready to Start last Night. thinging Sure I would go this Morning. but at 9. O. clock last Night ordere Came for My Captain to go and that Hancock Could Not Spare me.  excuse me Em but I Could Not help it I let out Some big oaths against the Genl but I was terrible angry and did Not Care what I Said if I had been drinking I Most assuredly would have got tight.  I was invited over a half a dozen time to take a drink of whiskey but I Could Not See it. they all thought Sure that I would drink for to drown My disapointement but they were Mistaken. and gave Me great credit this Morning they all said they were Sure I would drink last night I was So Mad. it May be all for the best I did Not go home for it would have broken a hundred dollar bill. and I Could Not Stand it. My two trips home this wiinter Cost me nearly $500. and think I will want all the Spare change I Can get by Next august dont you dear. but I May be Sent Next friday to Baltimore if I do. I will be home on Monday. but I dont Care Now whether I go or Not in about two Months More I will go for good and I will be My own Bos.  the weather is beautifull out here at present.  if it holds out you May expect to hear of the army Moving very Soon.  I dont know as I have any thing More to Say.  My kind remembrances to the Knight family.  hoping this will find you enjoying the best of health as it leave Me.  Now My dear Em good Night.  believe Me to be with the deepest and Most affectionate love.  yours truly and only yours </br>

I received a letter from you to day. and you Cannot imagine how Much pleasure I received from it.  and I answer it immediatly but dont know whether I Can Send it away or Not. as I am writing we are expecting a heavy attack in our left.  I have just this Minuet deployed My Men while So doing I received your ever welcome letter and you had better believe I deployed them quick. in the last four days this Corps has done Some of the heaviest fighting ever they done.  but we repulsed the army and made them change position.  My guard was pretty Safe all though at one time we were in the rifle pits and another we were supporting a battery.  I think to day will bring on Some heavy fighting.  but will be victorious on our Side. as every thing Seems lovely. you must excuse Me for Not responding to any of the points in your letter to me.  for I have not the time but accept the best & kindest love with many kisses from your ever affectionate and loving Eddie</br>
</br>
Our loss has been very heavy I think heavyer than the enemy as we were fighting in a Wilderness where the brush was So thick that you Could Not See the 10 feet a head of you.  the enemy Set fire to the brush the wind blowing from them and towards us.  which Made terrible havoc amongst our wound burning most of them to death.  it was horrible to think of.  but we Could not put fire out Nor Carry the wounded off.  excuse Me for Not writing more as the line is Commenced firing your Edwrd C Cauvet</br>
</br>
The skirmishing I heard was not much. just feeling each other there has been a dead Calm for over not an hour.  which I thinks Means Some thing and expect it will burst with a terrible fury when it does Come So no more from the battle feild at present and I hope to write next time from rishmond your Eddie</p></div><div class = "letter"><h4>May 11, 1864</h4><p></br></br>Near Spotslyvania on the River Po</br>

When I last wrote to you we were at todds Tavern and expecting a battle but it was Nothing but a Skirmish we arrived here that evening and Crossed the Po River on the Morning of the 10th we engaged the enemy. towards Noon all our forces were withundrawn acrossed the river but one division.  the first of our Corps which was left in the other Side to hold the position at two O clock PM we Commenced the attack which was kept up untill 5. O clock with Most terrific fury.  Contest being about even the loss on both Sides very heavy at Â½. O clock our hol whole  army Made a Charge on the enemy works.  but did Not succeed.  one division of our Corps Carried the first line of works also did one division of the 6th but owing to some misunderstanding the 5th Corps (the Centre) did not advance over 50 yds. which Caused the charge to fail our loss was very heavy. but we Captured 2.000 prisoners and 8 peices of Artillery Still it was a failure on our Side and weakened us Considerable. but there is Some Satisfaction to know that the enemy loss was as heavy. we lost one peice of artillery which was with the 1st division.  they were drove across the river.  through all the last Six days fighting. I Cannot Say we gained the Victory.  I Call it a draw.  but most people Call it a Victory but I dont See it. to day there was No battle. only heavy Skirmishing.  I went through the army this Morning looking for George I found his regiment after hunting through three lines of works.  way out to the front but George had Not arrived yet.  March 19th I had to Stop writing the other on account of Moving.  we arrived in this position at day light yesterday Morning and Charged the enemys works immediatly Carrying two lines.  Capturing 30 Odd peices of Cannnon and Many thousand prisoners.  Our loss was very heavy in killed and wounded.  I never See So many in any one battle.  the loss of our regts is exceedingly heavy especially in officers three Captain killed. Lt Col seright wounded.  also three Lieuts wounded. and two  missing.  Maguire is one of them.  there is Now two Lieuts in the regt for duty and about 70 men.  this has been the Severest battle on record.  the enemy have been reported to have fallen back through the Night.  all through So far it has been a Victory on our Side.  yesterdays fighting decided that but it has been dearly bought with Much love and affection.  I am as ever yours</br>

Your ever dear and Most welcome letter of 16th I received on the 22nd while at Milford.  I would have answered at before but we are Continually on the go.  from one place to another.  and allmost every day we have More or less fighting. but the big fight is too Come off to d yet.  Lee is now on the other Side of the river with 120.000 men which is More than we have got.  I dont hardly think he will Make a Stand. if he does we will have to cross the river and attack him to do that we ought to have 30.000 more men than he has.  Hanover junction is three miles from here.  last Night we had a Smart little fight. where we Carried their fort and took a Number of prisoners.  and I understand the 5th Corps took done about the Same on our right.  as we were marching done here last evening.  I See George.  he was swell and all right.  there is No use of me going into details of our Marches & fighting for you dont understand them. and if you do. you get the papers long before you get My letters.  Em we are going to have Some very hard work for the Next thirty days and if I live through it I will Come home at the expiration of that time.  to go roaming No More there is a first Lieut Comdg My regt and they want me to go back and take Command of it.  and I dont know what to do about. the officers of the regt want me very bad.  and the officers out of the regt advise Me to Stay where I am. they Say I would be very foolish to go back and My time So Near out.  what do you to think Em. will I go back or Not.  it is rather hard to See a Lieut in command when there is a Captain around.  but they out to Send our Lt Col out he is Still in new york.  he has Missed Most of all the battles the regt has been in. and it is about time he was out here.  I dont any thing else to write about.  every this is pretty quiet with the exception of the pickets.  who are continually Shooting at each other as if they Meant it.  and I Suppose they do.  I am very gratefull for that Stamp.  I See you are getting very thoughtfull.  Never Mind dear.  you Could Not have Sent it in a better time as I was all out of Stamps.  when I get a chance to buy some I will replace them.  I Suppose you received My last letter which was written about the 15th or 16th.  Em the people North Must Not get So crazy when they here of a Victory for the end is Not yet.  and the worst is too Come. we are 28 miles from Richmond but it will be a hard 28 miles to travel and the road Sides will be marked with graves graves instead of Mile Stones. you May expect to hear of Some of the greatest battles on record.  Lee will Contest every inch of ground between here and Richmond.  if we Succeed in forcing him back to that plack place the hardest fighting for me will be over as we will go into a regular Seize and take the plack place that way while they are doing that my time will be up Still if I thought the place would be taken before the fourth of july I would Stay and See it out. but I Shall not run any risks to Satisfie My Curiousty.  So with the deepest love & affection. I am as ever yours only Edwd C Cauvet</br>

Having a few leisure Moments I thought I would write a few lines and have it ready to Send when the mails leave for it is very un Certain when the do go. or when we receive one.  your last was dated at Brooklyn May 19th and was received by Me on the 30th. at the time it Came. it (the mail) went out immediatly and I had No chance of answering it I just Scrbbled a few lines in lead pencil to you to let you know that I received it and was well.  I Now embrace the oppertunity to answer it but I would rather embrace you at the present Moment.  and think you would rather have Me do So, So you Mother wishes I would write oftener. well My dear Em.  I Should be Most happy to do what your Mother wishes and also to have you write a little oftener to Me but Neither you or I Can Comply with the wishes as the Mails are So irregular. that we Can Not do it.  your last letter to Me was just Eleven (11) days Coming.  I wrote one to you on the 25 or 26th which I hope you have received. as the letters are few enough without being lost.  dear Em.  it May be very romantic and picturesque to you to ride over every day in a ferry boat and to travel up that hill but I dont think it will be So Nice for Me Next Month. to go from up town.  Cross the river and a travel up that hill & return in the Small hours of the Morning I dont think I will be able to See it. or I am afraid I Shall have to take board in the Knight family. or to immediatly take one of the Knight family to board with Me.  what do you think dear.  your Opinion on the Subject.  I have just had My hair Cut it is just about as Short as when I left three years ago.  I know you would be Much pleased if you See it.  and Say I look like a big loafer.  but I dont Care for looks out here.  I go in for Comfort.  it will be a Nice lett lenth. to go on picnics Next Month ,, how are you,, picnics.  you know you wont be able to go.  for you will want all your time to get ready to Change that dear Name of  yours Shortly.  I Shall have all the fun to Myself.  Sporting with the other peoples gals.  I think I hear you Say No you dont Eddie.  Iâ€™m going too.  but you know My dear you Cant Spare the time.  as for Me I will have over a month Spare time Nothing to do.  but Settle up My Company affairs  and that little affairs of ours.  but we will See.  but I dread that ferry boat and darn hill.  which will be on My route of March over to Brooklyn if I Could flank the Hill. the ferry boat obstacle Could be easy got over.  I have Not Seen George in Some time his Corps is on our left and I Could not find time to go See him.  but at the first oppertunity. I Shall do So.  and give him all your loves and get his in return  Em there will be nearly two Hundred men on paper left in the regt after it goes home and they will want to keep officers to Command them.  Now there is only two Captains in our regt. Very Captains Cooper and Myself.  the former is wounded very bad and will Not be able for duty in Several Months and I expect they will try their best to retain me.  in the regt.  but I Shall fight them out of it.  I have Made up My Mind to go home and home I shall go.  you Say you would like to be where there is excitement.  24 hours out here would Cure you of that.  I dont Say anything about the army for the reason that you See all the proceedings in the paper.  we have been in this position for three days.  but No General engagement has taken place.  Still there is at all times very heavy Skirmishing and artillery firing. at times we would think that the battle had opened the rapid firing of the Skirmishes and the whizzing of Shells would lead one to think the Ball had opened of Course Some body is getting hurt all the time.  the 42nd officers are Still at Me to Come and Command them they ask me Concerning every thing that is to transpire in the regt.  about who is to go home and whether we take our flag home. of course I put my Name down to go home.  I shall Now bring this to a close.  Not knowing at what time it will go.  remember me to your folks.  and Hoping this will find you enjoying good health as it leaves Me.  with Many kisses and any amount of love.  I remain very affectionatly yours only</br>

As yet No chance to send a Mail and if I keep on writing I will have a perfect diary to Send you this Morning at day light the troops charged the enemys fortification.  Carrying the first line.  but Could Not hold it the enemy opened grape & canister on us.  the loss of the Corps was pretty heavy but what it was or how it was with the other Corps.  I Cannot say.  but if they Catch it like ours did.  our army was weakened Considerable.  but I am in hopes. that their loses are not very heavy it is Comparitively quiet at present, troops Manuvering from one position to another. and I think fixing for a big fight this afternoon.  it rain pretty near all night. and a little through to day. which makes very good for our wounded which lays on the ground between the two lines.  Gen Smith reported to Gen Grant yesterday with twenty thousand Men I think before to Night or to morrow there will be the biggest fight on record  Beauregard & Breckenbridges forces was pitted against our Corps this Morning they are troops that have Not been in Lees army.  I think they have all the Men they Can get. Now in front of us. as I write their is Volleys of Muskets & a Sharp artillery fight going on in the 2nd Division every few minuets a Shell goes whistling over My head.  the prisoners I received this Morning begged of us Not to kill them I Suppose they have been told that the Yankees would kille them if they were taken.  they also say we fight like Barbarians it is easy known that they are new troops for the army of Lee by their talk the fighting is getting pretty sharp the enemy made the attack. So I Must cloce. with love &c &c from Eddie</p></div><div class = "letter"><h4>June 4, 1864</h4><p></br></br>June the 4th 1864</br>

Dear Em</br>
</br>
No fighting of any account yesterday afternoon.  just after dark last Night the johnys made a feirce attack on Gen Gibbons front.  (2nd Dives 2 Corps) which he repulsed hamsomely.  driving them back in Confusion and Capturing a few prisoners as a latter hour.  they Made another assault to his right. on the left of the 6th corps.  which was Served in the Same Manner as the first assault.  I hardly think the johnys will try it again.  and I am thinking our forces will not attack them.  for they are too Strongly entrenched and we loss too many men in Assaulting thier works.  I would Not be a bit Surprised if we again Moved by flank to the left.  I have not Seen George in Some time. Nor do I know how his Corps is making out.  and I expect he in the Same way about our Corps.  we all have enough to do to attend to our own Corps.  Up every Morning at Â½ past 2. O clock and Breakfast at three.  I am getting so used to it that I expect I will have to have it So.  when I Come home.  think you Could get Breakfast ready So early in the Morning hey Em. this is a beautifull Morning and everything is lovely and quiet.  but how long it will be So I aint Say.  I have Not been to the front this Morning. but I have plenty of time. it is only 4. O clock Em you think of longs days at home.  but to get up at 2. O clock and be under fire all day long Seems to be just about a week.  to day is just one Month Since we broke Camp and every day of that we have heard the rattle of Musketry & booming of Cannons. they Speak of war in olden times. but it was Not but a pleasure party Compared with this Campaign.  I hope by the time this letter is mailed that will be enough writing in it to Compensate you for My last letter. it was So Short.  this month will be the longest to me than any Month since I entered the Service.  but as you Say in one of your letters every thing has an end So will this Month.  I will now close this letter or you will get tired of reading so much on one day and I want a letter soon. to write to morrow if it dont go to day. with undying love & affection.  I am truly & Sincerly your Eddie</br>

dear Em your very welcome letters of 26. 27th arrived to day and I Sure they were received. with much pleasure.  it was the first mail I have received since I received your last.  but My dear Em.  they are better late than never only I wish they would Come on time and Not both together Still I kinder expected two letters by this mail and I was not dissapointed there was another officer wounded in the 42nd last Night never fear Em I have Made up My Mind Not to Make an application to go back to my regiment.  I Shall stay where I am. Now the Col is back but if they keep on wounding & killing all the officers as they have been doing I expect I will be ordered back.  but I would rather Stay where I am this Month.  I have My wall tent to sleep in while in the regt they are lying in trenches up to their eyes in dirt.  it is raining to night.  every things has been pretty quiet to day.  I am glad to hear that you enjoy good health.  Mine Never was better.  I hope this letter will be dated often enough for you.  Never Mind dear it Shows that I am Constantly thinking of you and me best wish is that I will return home Safe on the 28th of the Month.. an then but never mind what then we will fit that between us.  I wish we would get in front of Richmond. so that we Could Commence Seizing the place and then their would not be much more fighting until after the 28th of the month.  Somehow I begin to have a dread of battle. I never felt So before.  I  Suppose it because My time as So near out, and everybody Saying  . . . you will get peppered yet before you go home but I didnâ€™t see it.  I think . . .  will be with you all right before the forth of july.  I did not mean any thing insulting to you Em. about those postage stamps.  I thought it very kind and thoughtful in you to do  So and in a joke I said I would replace them if you get angry at what I said I shall give your hair a good pulling next month when I come home .  So the Ks had a big reception in Brooklyn. well that is a pet regt of that one home town.  I hope when we come home will be No one to give us a reception then we go home at once and Mind our own business for I know there will be many a Scene with Some of the irishmens wives. who would be very apt to rush out and embrace their dear husbands and March up Broadway with them in Spite of what the officers Could Say or do and I dont Care about witnessing any such feats or do I Care about having any Such recruits in My Company that day.  I want to go to a rendevous and dismiss and go where I please instead of making a Show of myself.  but I think My Self very lucky to get home in any Shape. as longs as I am well.  I think I Shall close for to Night. as the mail dont leave before to morrow at 8. O clock.  and I may want to put some more to it in the Morning So with love. wishes. respects. &c &c. I remain as ever Eddie</br>

4. A. M. The pickets and artillery were blazing away at each other all Night.  I Suppose it was done. to keep the Men from throwing up New works in advance of the ones allready built it Made me think of two years ago when we were down this way. then then was firing all night and every night and I suppose it will So here from this out.  the Mail leave at 8. O clock this morning for the White house I expect they will Now run regular. I hope So it is raing this morning every thing pretty quiet. after the Confusion last Night. So No more at present from your Eddie I hope you will excuse the lenth of this diary as I Can Call it Nothing else write soon and often for it will be a long month. with love &c &c from eddie</p></div><div class = "letter"><h4>June 9, 1864</h4><p></br></br>Near Coal Harbor Va</br>

</br>
Doing Nothing at present I thought I would Sit down and have a little chat with you My dear.  Still I have Nothing Much to Say. for it is Nothing but grim war out this way and at present there is Not Much of that going on.  at a little Cannonading & Musketry Now and then.  Col Lynch was wounded the day after he arrived.  only Slightly.  just enough to keep him out of harm untill the regt goes home.  Maguire is Now Commanding the regt and is doing right well with it and is Spoken very highly of in the Brigade for which I am very glad.  as he is My pupil and has been ever Since the war broke out we are looking very anxiously. for the 28th of june and None More So than Me My officers Say the first thing in the Morning and the last thing at Night.  Covey is talking about going home the 28th of june and the Tammany Regt. they Say I am getting crazy. over it. and I allmost think I am the Ast Provost Marshall.  had his leg Shot off while Standing in front of his tent the other Night.  I had just left him about a Second and was only about twenty feet from him as the Shell Came.  he was to go home on the 23rd of the Month. and we were talking of what a gay time we would have in New york.  little thinking his leg would be off inside of a Minuet.  he is Not expected to recover.  but I hope he will.  he was a fine Man.  and full of life.  he is the third one on Hancocks Staff that has been wounded It would be rather hard if they should take Coveys leg off before he got out of this dont you think So dear.  Still that would be better than taken off his head with a 32. lbs. Shot. which fly over these Hd Qrs. at times pretty lively.  we had to change Hd Qrs on account of them Coming So fast. but we are Still in range.  I hope this digging and Mining will Continue for over twenty days.  if it does there will Not be Much fighting.  and by that time I will be on My way for old New york Never to go roaming or Soldiering again.  I did expect to See Richmond.  Nor am I anxious at present.  I did hope to be their before My time was out.  but Now I dont Care. for there will be Some of the hardest fighting the world ever Say before we take that place.  we expect to Stay here for Some time.  our tents are all up. and beds put in them.  I am Nearly as well fixed. as I was last winter.  While in the regt. they Cannot have even a peice of Shelter tent up. and they have to lay in the rifle pits. in dirt & Mud.  that is the difference of being on the Staff and with ones regiment. and dont you think I would be foolish to go back to the regiment with out being ordered.  I have Not been away from Hd Qrs. much So I have Not seen George.  his Corps is Now on our left.  I think I will have to bring this to an end. remember Me to all your folks. and accept truest & Most sincere love of your ever true</br>

I will only cross the Brookly ferrys. once a week how will you like that. if you Neglect me why you Can Blame me if I Should Neglect you.  There is every possibilities of My going back to the regt.  the Cheif of Staff Spoke to the Provost Marshall About it yesterday and Sayed I ought to go back.  So Much for having a good Name in the Corps.  if I had a poor Name.  they would never think of Sending me to Command My Regt.  Still the Provost Marshall will do all in his power to retain me here and here I want to Stay untill the 28th of this Month.  we are going to Move to Night and expect it wil be to the james River and across.  and so up the South Side and I hope by that time to be on My way home So you Can lookout for Me on the first of july.  we do Not leave here before the 28inst.  I have Not much News to write So I will bring this to a close.  with love.  best wishes & respects I remain your truly</br>

Yours of the 9th received last night or rather this Morning at 1. O clock and you Can recon I lost No time in reading it for I was glad to hear from you.  we are Now within 2 Miles of Petersburg.  yesterday our Corps Made another grand Charge Carring their first and in Some places their Second line of works and hold them Still but we had a hard time of it. fighting from three O clock yesterday untill Now but the johns Can not retake what they lost.  our loss was very heavy.  last we had to borrow 5.000 men from Burnside to Make a charge on the left.  which was done hansomely.  Still we Can Not drive them from there Position.  as they are too Strongly fortified for us. and by Charging our their worke we weaken ourselves. and this Corps is getting played out on Charging.  the men begin to think.  that it is about time they had some thing else to do.  the Niggers fought very well on the 15th there is lots of them here.  I have Not heard what our losses were in the regt yesterday the 5th Corps arrived here last Night.  I have Not Seen George. but will looke for him the first oppertunity and tell him to write and I Shall write to you Myself.  So you Say it will be down hill Comeing back but that all very Nice when a Mans far from home and out late.  tired and sleepy and No body to take Care of him.  I think you will have to See One home Em.  So to take Care of Me like you would on picternics yes I pay you a dollar a day in a hoin for every day you lose. but you must keep Steady to work. and Not lose any time.  well Em we can Now Shake hands on losing Money as I have done precisely the Same thing only Mine was lost by letter.  I wish you to suit yourself about that chain. and have it mounted to suit you.  I Shall pay for the handing & mounting and Shall fell feel angry with you Should your attempt to do So.  I Shall be Most Contented and perfectly happy to receive the chain from your hair.  So My dear just get it under way.

Your ever kind. affectionate and welcome letter Came to hand last evening and I was very happy in hearing from you.  I have Not much News to write, only yesterday and the day before, we have been fighting like the devil and Not gaining Much.  Still we did a little yesterday I went over to the 5th Corps to See George.  but he was out on the picket line. at least his regt was.  I went part the ways but I found out that it was untenantable. on horse back. and as I had Not Much business down that way I turned back.  So I did Not See him. but when I do I Shall mention about the rolls and Send you word I think it likely I will See him or Next day. for I want to See him before I go home.  So you dont think you Can ever live in New york without you have a whole house to your Self. well Em you must give up all idea of Marry Me for I dont think I shall occupy a whole house.  I am very  Sorry that I will lose you for I have been looking for the time to Come when I Could Call you mine.  but the heights of Brooklyn is putting high Notions in your head.  but Nothing like it My dear if you Can only Support your dignatary.  Now I would allmost be Contented with love in a Cottage. that is providing there was allways plenty to eat & drink.  but I must give up all my long cherished hopes I Suppose but My dear, for I call you So Still. wont you wait and have a long talk with your dear Eddie before you give him the mitten.  well I recon there is about enough of nonsense or you might think I was in earnest and you know I would not for a moment give you a minuets harm if I Can help. and Shall always do My best to please. aint that so dear.  So you will have a big Sheet to wave when I Come home. I would rather it would be a Shirt. I mean a clean one. for I expect I will need one very much about that time.  I am glad there is No time made over returning regiments. as all this show is all played out. I want to go right to a rendevous and dismiss untill all necessary papers are made out. Em look for Me on the first of july over in Brooklyn it is only 9 days to day but I see a Lieut. that was to go home to Morrow have a leg shot off today. Hows is that Em rather tough aint it.  My most Sincer and true love.  I Shant Send you no kisses as they are no good on paper I Shall reserve them untill I Come then look out Em for sore lips. No More from your for </br>

Yours of the 15th Came to hand last evening. but I was So tired I did Not answer it. but went to Sleep as Soon as Camp was established.  we left our old position yesterday Morning. as we thought for a Couple days rest. on account of the 9th Corps relieving us taking our position.  but I Suppose there is No rest for the wicked. and that is us the 2 Corps. instead of rest we were Marched a round about way to get here going about 8 miles for three the weather was excessively warm and dust So thick one could hardly See the file a head of him. but we arrived here and immediatly went into position and found the enemy.  Captured a Col and few men. losing a few ourselves in killed & wounded, I believe if we Could form a line of battle from Washington to the Gulf of Mexico we would find the Same number of Jonnys in our front, No matter where it is they Seem to have More men than we do.  I dont know how it is but it is a Scandalous fact. that right My dear always Say wimb for leg for you know dear it is very impolite & vulgar to Say leg.  So you think if I Stayed in the army another three years you would be a fit Subject for the Crazy house.  Now My dear I hardly think it would be as bad as that but I think you would just be Mad enough to let Ed Slide.  but never mind dear I am Sick enough of this. Not to want to go even for Six months again.  Not even for a Minuett My patriotism is all wayed  out.  I am glad to hear that George was well I have not Seen him yet, yes Em I wish he was as Comfortable Situated as I am.  it is just three years to day Since I was Mustered in the Service of the United States. Next tuesday I will take My departure for New York & ,, Brooklyn,, we have had no rain for some time and is kneeded very Much.  My dear you Need Not ans this letter as I expect to be on My way to you before your letter Could get here then wont we have a gay time Ill bet you.  I Shall Now Stop writing as there is Nothing else to write only we are again Moving by the flank. So with love. best wishes.

My dearest Emma,</br>
</br>
Yours of the 19th Came duly to hand I was very glad to hear from So Soon. and I think I will answer it immedialty. for I think it will be My last letter to you untill I Come home.  then I will have to write from New York to you in Brooklyn. as it will be Most to Much for Me to do to go over to Brooklyn very often especially in hot weather I have very disagreeable News to Chronicle this time in My letter. in My last letter I mentioned about a Severe fight well in that fight the enemy broke through our Centre and rushed to our right. Carring with them three whole regiments. 19. & 15th Mass & 42 NY Vols. taken Colors and all they also Captured Many More of the Brigade with them but fortunately the 59. & 82 NY and 106 Penn & 19 Maine Seen it in time to Send their Colors to the rear. we will have about 20 Men to go home from the front. Most of them being detailed men at the different head Quarters and on Waggon train and have Never hardly done a days Soldiery Since entering the Service. in fact never had a Musket in their hands.  Maguire is Safe he being to the rear Sick for Nearly a week he and Myself are all the officers here belonging to the regt.  I received a letter from the Col yesterday. who States that he and a Couple More of the officers are having fine times at the Hotel at Annapolis and that they will join Men Me on the way home.  we are about to Make another Move and I think we will recross the james river.  and Move on to Richmond from Malvern Hills.  I just believe we will have to have another Call for troops before we Can take Richmond.  our division alone loss 17.00 men on the 22nd.  I tell you it Makes a big holes in the Corps.  I might as well Say there is No Tammany Regt Now in the feild as there are Scattered Regt in all directions.  Making in all about 50. men old and new. Em I am getting throughly disgusted with the war. and you Need never have any fears of Me returning to it.  I would allmost be Content to work for $1.00 a day before I would Come in to the Service again.  I will Now close with the best wishes and Most affectionate love and the fond hopes of Seeing you Soon.  I remain as ever yours Most truly</br>

I am anxiously waiting for the time to Come. I know the punishment will be terrible.  yes dear I think you have writing quiet often of late but Not to often for Me.  So you thought I was an exception from the rest of mankind.  Now My dear. I know you are joking. and plastering it on pretty thick Oh I am So sorry that the Army has Spoilt Me.  I am afraid it has ruined me entirely and if all the folks north encourage the Soldiers like Some body I know.  I hardly think they will ever regain their lost ground.  Never Mind dear you will See when your dear Eddie Comes home whether he is a Spoilt child or not.  but I recon I dont pay any young lady a dollar a day for sporting around with me.  I Cant See it in that light.  I am glad to hear you have heard from George.  I have had no chance of Seeing him we are Some distance apart I Shall Now close My dear. with love &c &c from yorus So truly</br>

<!--p class= "bodypar">The organizing principle of the University of St. Thomas FREE Project is to change how we (and those around us) see the question of slavery itself by placing the &quot;strange&quot; aspects of contemporary global slavery in conversation with the &quot;familiar&quot; consequences of America&apos;s long struggle for abolition and emancipation.  We want to show how young women bought and sold for sex in Chiang Mai, Thailand are not distant or exotic&hyphen;they belong within the same global human community that we, as university students and faculty, do, and their humanity and ours depend upon each other.  At the same time, we want to shine a critical light on the historical origins and persistent impacts of economic and political practices in our own communities that many of us accept as routine.  If we see slavery as an aberration, confined to other times and other regions and practiced outside of our familiar sociopolitical climate, we rest easy in our distance from it.  If instead we recognize that emancipation&apos;s work is ongoing and that obstacles to its completion have persisted and even grown in the very sociopolitical climate we consider antithetical to slavery, then human unfreedom emerges as an intolerable indictment to our highest hopes as a society.</p-->
